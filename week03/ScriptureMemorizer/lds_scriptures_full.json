  "The Son Of Alma 3:7": "And their brethren sought to destroy them, therefore they were",
  "The Son Of Alma 3:8": "And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the",
  "The Son Of Alma 3:9": "And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of",
  "The Son Of Alma 3:10": "Therefore, whosoever suffered himself to be led away by the",
  "The Son Of Alma 3:11": "And it came to pass that whosoever would not believe in the",
  "The Son Of Alma 3:12": "And it is they who have kept the records which are true of their",
  "The Son Of Alma 3:13": "Now we will return again to the Amlicites, for they also had a",
  "The Son Of Alma 3:14": "Thus the word of God is fulfilled, for these are the words which",
  "The Son Of Alma 3:15": "And again: I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with",
  "The Son Of Alma 3:16": "And again: I will set a mark upon him that fighteth against thee",
  "The Son Of Alma 3:17": "And again, I say he that departeth from thee shall no more be",
  "The Son Of Alma 3:18": "Now the Amlicites knew not that they were fulfilling the words of",
  "The Son Of Alma 3:19": "Now I would that ye should see that they brought upon themselves",
  "The Son Of Alma 3:20": "Now it came to pass that not many days after the battle which was",
  "The Son Of Alma 3:21": "And it came to pass that there was an army sent to drive them out",
  "The Son Of Alma 3:22": "Now Alma himself being afflicted with a wound did not go up to",
  "The Son Of Alma 3:23": "But he sent up a numerous army against them; and they went up and",
  "The Son Of Alma 3:24": "And then they returned again and began to establish peace in the",
  "The Son Of Alma 3:25": "Now all these things were done, yea, all these wars and",
  "The Son Of Alma 3:26": "And in one year were thousands and tens of thousands of souls sent",
  "The Son Of Alma 3:27": "For every man receiveth wages of him whom he listeth to obey, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 4:1": "Now it came to pass in the sixth year of the reign of the judges",
  "The Son Of Alma 4:2": "But the people were afflicted, yea, greatly afflicted for the loss",
  "The Son Of Alma 4:3": "And so great were their afflictions that every soul had cause to",
  "The Son Of Alma 4:4": "And they began to establish the church more fully; yea, and many",
  "The Son Of Alma 4:5": "And it came to pass in the seventh year of the reign of the judges",
  "The Son Of Alma 4:6": "And it came to pass in the eighth year of the reign of the judges,",
  "The Son Of Alma 4:7": "Now this was the cause of much affliction to Alma, yea, and to many",
  "The Son Of Alma 4:8": "For they saw and beheld with great sorrow that the people of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 4:9": "And thus, in this eighth year of the reign of the judges, there",
  "The Son Of Alma 4:10": "And thus ended the eighth year of the reign of the judges; and the",
  "The Son Of Alma 4:11": "And it came to pass in the commencement of the ninth year, Alma",
  "The Son Of Alma 4:12": "Yea, he saw great inequality among the people, some lifting",
  "The Son Of Alma 4:13": "Now this was a great cause for lamentations among the people,",
  "The Son Of Alma 4:14": "Looking forward to that day, thus retaining a remission of their",
  "The Son Of Alma 4:15": "And now it came to pass that Alma, having seen the afflictions of",
  "The Son Of Alma 4:16": "And he selected a wise man who was among the elders of the church,",
  "The Son Of Alma 4:17": "Now this man’s name was Nephihah, and he was appointed chief",
  "The Son Of Alma 4:18": "Now Alma did not grant unto him the office of being high priest",
  "The Son Of Alma 4:19": "And this he did that he himself might go forth among his people,",
  "The Son Of Alma 4:20": "And thus in the commencement of the ninth year of the reign of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:1": "Now it came to pass that Alma began to deliver the word of God unto",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:2": "And these are the words which he spake to the people in the church",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:3": "I, Alma, having been consecrated by my father, Alma, to be a high",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:4": "And behold, I say unto you, they were delivered out of the hands of",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:5": "And behold, after that, they were brought into bondage by the hands",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:6": "And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, you that belong to",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:7": "Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:8": "And now I ask of you, my brethren, were they destroyed? Behold, I",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:9": "And again I ask, were the bands of death broken, and the chains of",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:10": "And now I ask of you on what conditions are they saved? Yea, what",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:11": "Behold, I can tell you—did not my father Alma believe in the words",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:12": "And according to his faith there was a mighty change wrought in",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:13": "And behold, he preached the word unto your fathers, and a mighty",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:14": "And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:15": "Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you? Do",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:16": "I say unto you, can you imagine to yourselves that ye hear the",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:17": "Or do ye imagine to yourselves that ye can lie unto the Lord in",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:18": "Or otherwise, can ye imagine yourselves brought before the",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:19": "I say unto you, can ye look up to God at that day with a pure",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:20": "I say unto you, can ye think of being saved when you have yielded",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:21": "I say unto you, ye will know at that day that ye cannot be saved;",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:22": "And now I ask of you, my brethren, how will any of you feel, if ye",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:23": "Behold will they not testify that ye are murderers, yea, and also",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:24": "Behold, my brethren, do ye suppose that such an one can have a",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:25": "I say unto you, Nay; except ye make our Creator a liar from the",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:26": "And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:27": "Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless before God? Could ye",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:28": "Behold, are ye stripped of pride? I say unto you, if ye are not ye",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:29": "Behold, I say, is there one among you who is not stripped of envy?",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:30": "And again I say unto you, is there one among you that doth make a",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:31": "Wo unto such an one, for he is not prepared, and the time is at",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:32": "Yea, even wo unto all ye workers of iniquity; repent, repent, for",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:33": "Behold, he sendeth an invitation unto all men, for the arms of",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:34": "Yea, he saith: Come unto me and ye shall partake of the fruit of",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:35": "Yea, come unto me and bring forth works of righteousness, and ye",

  "The Son Of Alma 5:39": "And now if ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd, of what fold",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:40": "For I say unto you that whatsoever is good cometh from God, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:41": "Therefore, if a man bringeth forth good works he hearkeneth unto",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:42": "And whosoever doeth this must receive his wages of him; therefore,",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:43": "And now, my brethren, I would that ye should hear me, for I speak",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:44": "For I am called to speak after this manner, according to the holy",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:45": "And this is not all. Do ye not suppose that I know of these things",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:46": "Behold, I say unto you they are made known unto me by the Holy",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:47": "And moreover, I say unto you that it has thus been revealed unto",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:48": "I say unto you, that I know of myself that whatsoever I shall say",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:49": "And now I say unto you that this is the order after which I am",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:50": "Yea, thus saith the Spirit: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, for",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:51": "And also the Spirit saith unto me, yea, crieth unto me with a",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:52": "And again I say unto you, the Spirit saith: Behold, the ax is laid",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:53": "And now my beloved brethren, I say unto you, can ye withstand",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:54": "Yea, will ye persist in supposing that ye are better one than",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:55": "Yea, and will you persist in turning your backs upon the poor, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:56": "And finally, all ye that will persist in your wickedness, I say",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:57": "And now I say unto you, all you that are desirous to follow the",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:58": "For the names of the righteous shall be written in the book of",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:59": "For what shepherd is there among you having many sheep doth not",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:60": "And now I say unto you that the good shepherd doth call after you;",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:61": "And now I, Alma, do command you in the language of him who hath",
  "The Son Of Alma 5:62": "I speak by way of command unto you that belong to the church; and",
  "The Son Of Alma 6:1": "And now it came to pass that after Alma had made an end of speaking",
  "The Son Of Alma 6:2": "And it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the church who",
  "The Son Of Alma 6:3": "And it also came to pass that whosoever did belong to the church",
  "The Son Of Alma 6:4": "And thus they began to establish the order of the church in the",
  "The Son Of Alma 6:5": "Now I would that ye should understand that the word of God was",
  "The Son Of Alma 6:6": "Nevertheless the children of God were commanded that they should",
  "The Son Of Alma 6:7": "And now it came to pass that when Alma had made these regulations",
  "The Son Of Alma 6:8": "And Alma went and began to declare the word of God unto the church",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:1": "Behold my beloved brethren, seeing that I have been permitted to",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:2": "And even I could not have come now at this time were it not that",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:3": "And behold, I have come having great hopes and much desire that I",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:4": "But blessed be the name of God, that he hath given me to know, yea,",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:5": "And I trust, according to the Spirit of God which is in me, that I",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:6": "But behold, I trust that ye are not in a state of so much unbelief",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:7": "For behold, I say unto you there be many things to come; and",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:8": "Behold, I do not say that he will come among us at the time of his",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:9": "But behold, the Spirit hath said this much unto me, saying: Cry",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:10": "And behold, he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is the",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:11": "And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:12": "And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:13": "Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:14": "Now I say unto you that ye must repent, and be born again; for the",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:15": "Yea, I say unto you come and fear not, and lay aside every sin,",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:16": "And whosoever doeth this, and keepeth the commandments of God from",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:17": "And now my beloved brethren, do you believe these things? Behold,",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:18": "For as I said unto you from the beginning, that I had much desire",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:19": "For I perceive that ye are in the paths of righteousness; I",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:20": "I perceive that it has been made known unto you, by the testimony",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:21": "And he doth not dwell in unholy temples; neither can filthiness or",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:22": "And now my beloved brethren, I have said these things unto you",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:23": "And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:24": "And see that ye have faith, hope, and charity, and then ye will",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:25": "And may the Lord bless you, and keep your garments spotless, that",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:26": "And now my beloved brethren, I have spoken these words unto you",
  "The Son Of Alma 7:27": "And now, may the peace of God rest upon you, and upon your houses",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:1": "And now it came to pass that Alma returned from the land of Gideon,",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:2": "And thus ended the ninth year of the reign of the judges over the",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:3": "And it came to pass in the commencement of the tenth year of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:4": "And he began to teach the people in the land of Melek according to",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:5": "And it came to pass that the people came to him throughout all the",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:6": "So that when he had finished his work at Melek he departed thence,",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:7": "Now it was the custom of the people of Nephi to call their lands,",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:8": "And it came to pass that when Alma had come to the city of",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:9": "Now Satan had gotten great hold upon the hearts of the people of",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:10": "Nevertheless Alma labored much in the spirit, wrestling with God",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:11": "Nevertheless, they hardened their hearts, saying unto him: Behold,",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:12": "And now we know that because we are not of thy church we know that",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:13": "Now when the people had said this, and withstood all his words,",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:14": "And it came to pass that while he was journeying thither, being",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:15": "Blessed art thou, Alma; therefore, lift up thy head and rejoice,",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:16": "And behold, I am sent to command thee that thou return to the city",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:17": "For behold, they do study at this time that they may destroy the",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:18": "Now it came to pass that after Alma had received his message from",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:19": "And as he entered the city he was an hungered, and he said to a",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:20": "And the man said unto him: I am a Nephite, and I know that thou",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:21": "And it came to pass that the man received him into his house; and",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:22": "And it came to pass that Alma ate bread and was filled; and he",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:23": "And after he had eaten and was filled he said unto Amulek: I am",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:24": "And behold, I have been called to preach the word of God among all",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:25": "But behold, I have been commanded that I should turn again and",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:26": "And now, Amulek, because thou hast fed me and taken me in, thou",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:27": "And Alma tarried many days with Amulek before he began to preach",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:28": "And it came to pass that the people did wax more gross in their",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:29": "And the word came to Alma, saying: Go; and also say unto my",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:30": "And Alma went forth, and also Amulek, among the people, to declare",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:31": "And they had power given unto them, insomuch that they could not",
  "The Son Of Alma 8:32": "And it came to pass that they went forth and began to preach and",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:1": "And again, I, Alma, having been commanded of God that I should take",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:2": "Who art thou? Suppose ye that we shall believe the testimony of one",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:3": "Now they understood not the words which they spake; for they knew",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:4": "And they said also: We will not believe thy words if thou shouldst",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:5": "Now they knew not that God could do such marvelous works, for they",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:6": "And they said: Who is God, that sendeth no more authority than one",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:7": "And they stood forth to lay their hands on me; but behold, they did",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:8": "Behold, O ye wicked and perverse generation, how have ye forgotten",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:9": "Do ye not remember that our father, Lehi, was brought out of",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:10": "And have ye forgotten so soon how many times he delivered our",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:11": "Yea, and if it had not been for his matchless power, and his",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:12": "Behold, now I say unto you that he commandeth you to repent; and",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:13": "Behold, do ye not remember the words which he spake unto Lehi,",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:14": "Now I would that ye should remember, that inasmuch as the",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:15": "Nevertheless I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:16": "For there are many promises which are extended to the Lamanites;",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:17": "And at some period of time they will be brought to believe in his",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:18": "But behold, I say unto you that if ye persist in your wickedness",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:19": "For he will not suffer you that ye shall live in your iniquities,",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:20": "Yea, after having been such a highly favored people of the Lord;",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:21": "Having been visited by the Spirit of God; having conversed with",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:22": "Yea, and after having been delivered of God out of the land of",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:23": "And now behold I say unto you, that if this people, who have",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:24": "For behold, the promises of the Lord are extended to the",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:25": "And now for this cause, that ye may not be destroyed, the Lord has",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:26": "And not many days hence the Son of God shall come in his glory;",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:27": "And behold, he cometh to redeem those who will be baptized unto",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:28": "Therefore, prepare ye the way of the Lord, for the time is at hand",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:29": "Now behold, this is the voice of the angel, crying unto the",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:30": "And now, my beloved brethren, for ye are my brethren, and ye ought",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:31": "Now it came to pass that when I, Alma, had spoken these words,",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:32": "And also because I said unto them that they were a lost and a",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:33": "But it came to pass that the Lord did not suffer them that they",
  "The Son Of Alma 9:34": "And it came to pass that Amulek went and stood forth, and began to",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:1": "Now these are the words which Amulek preached unto the people who",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:2": "I am Amulek; I am the son of Giddonah, who was the son of Ishmael,",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:3": "And Aminadi was a descendant of Nephi, who was the son of Lehi,",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:4": "And behold, I am also a man of no small reputation among all those",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:5": "Nevertheless, after all this, I never have known much of the ways",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:6": "Nevertheless, I did harden my heart, for I was called many times",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:7": "As I was journeying to see a very near kindred, behold an angel of",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:8": "And it came to pass that I obeyed the voice of the angel, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:9": "And the angel said unto me he is a holy man; wherefore I know he",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:10": "And again, I know that the things whereof he hath testified are",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:11": "For behold, he hath blessed mine house, he hath blessed me, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:12": "And now, when Amulek had spoken these words the people began to",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:13": "Nevertheless, there were some among them who thought to question",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:14": "Now it was those men who sought to destroy them, who were",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:15": "Now these lawyers were learned in all the arts and cunning of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:16": "And it came to pass that they began to question Amulek, that",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:17": "Now they knew not that Amulek could know of their designs. But it",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:18": "Ye are laying plans to pervert the ways of the righteous, and to",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:19": "Yea, well did Mosiah say, who was our last king, when he was",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:20": "And now I say unto you that well doth the Lord judge of your",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:21": "Yea, well doth he cry, by the voice of his angels that: I will",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:22": "Yea, and I say unto you that if it were not for the prayers of",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:23": "But it is by the prayers of the righteous that ye are spared; now",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:24": "And now it came to pass that the people were more angry with",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:25": "But Amulek stretched forth his hand, and cried the mightier unto",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:26": "For behold, have I testified against your law? Ye do not",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:27": "And now behold, I say unto you, that the foundation of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:28": "And now it came to pass that when Amulek had spoken these words",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:29": "And again, he has reviled against our lawyers, and our judges.",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:30": "And it came to pass that the lawyers put it into their hearts",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:31": "And there was one among them whose name was Zeezrom. Now he was",
  "The Son Of Alma 10:32": "Now the object of these lawyers was to get gain; and they got",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:1": "Now it was in the law of Mosiah that every man who was a judge of",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:2": "Now if a man owed another, and he would not pay that which he did",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:3": "And the judge received for his wages according to his time—a",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:4": "Now these are the names of the different pieces of their gold, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:5": "Now the reckoning is thus—a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:6": "A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:7": "A senum of silver was equal to a senine of gold, and either for a",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:8": "Now the amount of a seon of gold was twice the value of a senine.",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:9": "And a shum of gold was twice the value of a seon.",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:10": "And a limnah of gold was the value of them all.",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:11": "And an amnor of silver was as great as two senums.",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:12": "And an ezrom of silver was as great as four senums.",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:13": "And an onti was as great as them all.",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:14": "Now this is the value of the lesser numbers of their reckoning—",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:15": "A shiblon is half of a senum; therefore, a shiblon for half a",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:16": "And a shiblum is a half of a shiblon.",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:17": "And a leah is the half of a shiblum.",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:18": "Now this is their number, according to their reckoning.",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:19": "Now an antion of gold is equal to three shiblons.",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:20": "Now, it was for the sole purpose to get gain, because they",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:21": "And this Zeezrom began to question Amulek, saying: Will ye answer",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:22": "And Amulek said unto him: Yea, if it be according to the Spirit",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:23": "Now Amulek said: O thou child of hell, why tempt ye me? Knowest",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:24": "Believest thou that there is no God? I say unto you, Nay, thou",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:25": "And now thou hast lied before God unto me. Thou saidst unto",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:26": "And Zeezrom said unto him: Thou sayest there is a true and living",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:27": "And Amulek said: Yea, there is a true and living God.",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:28": "Now Zeezrom said: Is there more than one God?",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:29": "And he answered, No.",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:30": "Now Zeezrom said unto him again: How knowest thou these things?",

  "The Son Of Alma 11:32": "And Zeezrom said again: Who is he that shall come? Is it the Son",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:33": "And he said unto him, Yea.",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:34": "And Zeezrom said again: Shall he save his people in their sins?",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:35": "Now Zeezrom said unto the people: See that ye remember these",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:36": "Now Amulek saith again unto him: Behold thou hast lied, for thou",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:37": "And I say unto you again that he cannot save them in their sins;",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:38": "Now Zeezrom saith again unto him: Is the Son of God the very",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:39": "And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father of",

  "The Son Of Alma 11:44": "Now, this restoration shall come to all, both old and young, both",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:45": "Now, behold, I have spoken unto you concerning the death of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 11:46": "Now, when Amulek had finished these words the people began again",
  "The Son Of Alma 12:1": "Now Alma, seeing that the words of Amulek had silenced Zeezrom,",
  "The Son Of Alma 12:2": "Now the words that Alma spake unto Zeezrom were heard by the",
  "The Son Of Alma 12:3": "Now Zeezrom, seeing that thou hast been taken in thy lying and",
  "The Son Of Alma 12:4": "And thou seest that we know that thy plan was a very subtle plan,",
  "The Son Of Alma 12:5": "Now this was a plan of thine adversary, and he hath exercised his",
  "The Son Of Alma 12:6": "And behold I say unto you all that this was a snare of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 12:7": "Now when Alma had spoken these words, Zeezrom began to tremble",
  "The Son Of Alma 12:8": "And Zeezrom began to inquire of them diligently, that he might",
  "The Son Of Alma 12:9": "And now Alma began to expound these things unto him, saying: It is",

  "The Son Of Alma 12:18": "Then, I say unto you, they shall be as though there had been no",
  "The Son Of Alma 12:19": "Now it came to pass that when Alma had made an end of speaking",
  "The Son Of Alma 12:20": "But there was one Antionah, who was a chief ruler among them,",
  "The Son Of Alma 12:21": "What does the scripture mean, which saith that God placed",

  "The Son Of Alma 14:2": "But the more part of them were desirous that they might destroy",
  "The Son Of Alma 14:3": "And they were also angry with Alma and Amulek; and because they",
  "The Son Of Alma 14:4": "But it came to pass that they did not; but they took them and",
  "The Son Of Alma 14:5": "And the people went forth and witnessed against them—testifying",

  "The Son Of Alma 14:13": "And Alma said: Be it according to the will of the Lord. But,",
  "The Son Of Alma 14:14": "Now it came to pass that when the bodies of those who had been",
  "The Son Of Alma 14:15": "Behold, ye see that ye had not power to save those who had been",
  "The Son Of Alma 14:16": "Now this judge was after the order and faith of Nehor, who slew",

  "The Son Of Alma 15:2": "And they related unto them all that had happened unto their wives",
  "The Son Of Alma 15:3": "And also Zeezrom lay sick at Sidom, with a burning fever, which",
  "The Son Of Alma 15:4": "Now, when he heard that Alma and Amulek were in the land of Sidom,",
  "The Son Of Alma 15:5": "And it came to pass that they went immediately, obeying the",
  "The Son Of Alma 15:6": "And it came to pass that Alma said unto him, taking him by the",
  "The Son Of Alma 15:7": "And he answered and said: Yea, I believe all the words that thou",

  "The Son Of Alma 15:11": "And when Alma had said these words, Zeezrom leaped upon his feet,",
  "The Son Of Alma 15:12": "And Alma baptized Zeezrom unto the Lord; and he began from that",
  "The Son Of Alma 15:13": "And Alma established a church in the land of Sidom, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 15:14": "And it came to pass that they were many; for they did flock in",
  "The Son Of Alma 15:15": "But as to the people that were in the land of Ammonihah, they yet",
  "The Son Of Alma 15:16": "And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek, Amulek having forsaken",
  "The Son Of Alma 15:17": "Therefore, after Alma having established the church at Sidom,",
  "The Son Of Alma 15:18": "Now as I said, Alma having seen all these things, therefore he",
  "The Son Of Alma 15:19": "And thus ended the tenth year of the reign of the judges over the",
  "The Son Of Alma 16:1": "And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 16:2": "For behold, the armies of the Lamanites had come in upon the",
  "The Son Of Alma 16:3": "And now it came to pass, before the Nephites could raise a",
  "The Son Of Alma 16:4": "Now it came to pass that the Nephites were desirous to obtain",
  "The Son Of Alma 16:5": "Therefore, he that had been appointed chief captain over the",
  "The Son Of Alma 16:6": "And it came to pass that Alma inquired of the Lord concerning the",
  "The Son Of Alma 16:7": "And it came to pass that Zoram and his sons crossed over the river",

  "The Son Of Alma 16:11": "Nevertheless, after many days their dead bodies were heaped up",
  "The Son Of Alma 16:12": "And the Lamanites did not come again to war against the Nephites",
  "The Son Of Alma 16:13": "And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance to the people",
  "The Son Of Alma 16:14": "And as many as would hear their words, unto them they did impart",
  "The Son Of Alma 16:15": "And thus did Alma and Amulek go forth, and also many more who had",
  "The Son Of Alma 16:16": "And there was no inequality among them; the Lord did pour out his",
  "The Son Of Alma 16:17": "That they might not be hardened against the word, that they might",
  "The Son Of Alma 16:18": "Now those priests who did go forth among the people did preach",
  "The Son Of Alma 16:19": "Holding forth things which must shortly come; yea, holding forth",
  "The Son Of Alma 16:20": "And many of the people did inquire concerning the place where the",
  "The Son Of Alma 16:21": "And now after the church had been established throughout all the",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:1": "And now it came to pass that as Alma was journeying from the land",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:2": "Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:3": "But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:4": "And they had been teaching the word of God for the space of",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:5": "Now these are the circumstances which attended them in their",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:6": "Now these were their journeyings: Having taken leave of their",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:7": "Nevertheless they departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and took",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:8": "And thus they departed into the wilderness with their numbers",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:9": "And it came to pass that they journeyed many days in the",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:10": "And it came to pass that the Lord did visit them with his Spirit,",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:11": "And the Lord said unto them also: Go forth among the Lamanites,",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:12": "And it came to pass that the hearts of the sons of Mosiah, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:13": "And it came to pass when they had arrived in the borders of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:14": "And assuredly it was great, for they had undertaken to preach the",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:15": "Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:16": "Therefore, this was the cause for which the sons of Mosiah had",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:17": "Therefore they separated themselves one from another, and went",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:18": "Now Ammon being the chief among them, or rather he did administer",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:19": "And Ammon went to the land of Ishmael, the land being called",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:20": "And as Ammon entered the land of Ishmael, the Lamanites took him",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:21": "And thus Ammon was carried before the king who was over the land",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:22": "And the king inquired of Ammon if it were his desire to dwell in",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:23": "And Ammon said unto him: Yea, I desire to dwell among this people",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:24": "And it came to pass that king Lamoni was much pleased with Ammon,",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:25": "But Ammon said unto him: Nay, but I will be thy servant.",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:26": "And after he had been in the service of the king three days, as",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:27": "Therefore, as Ammon and the servants of the king were driving",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:28": "Now the servants of the king began to murmur, saying: Now the",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:29": "Now they wept because of the fear of being slain. Now when Ammon",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:30": "And now, these were the thoughts of Ammon, when he saw the",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:31": "And it came to pass that he flattered them by his words, saying:",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:32": "And it came to pass that they went in search of the flocks, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:33": "And those men again stood to scatter their flocks; but Ammon said",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:34": "Therefore, they did as Ammon commanded them, and he went forth",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:35": "Therefore they did not fear Ammon, for they supposed that one of",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:36": "But Ammon stood forth and began to cast stones at them with his",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:37": "But behold, every man that lifted his club to smite Ammon, he",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:38": "Now six of them had fallen by the sling, but he slew none save it",
  "The Son Of Alma 17:39": "And when he had driven them afar off, he returned and they",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:1": "And it came to pass that king Lamoni caused that his servants",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:2": "And when they had all testified to the things which they had seen,",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:3": "And they answered the king, and said: Whether he be the Great",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:4": "And now, when the king heard these words, he said unto them: Now I",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:5": "Now this was the tradition of Lamoni, which he had received from",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:6": "For he had slain many of them because their brethren had scattered",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:7": "Now it was the practice of these Lamanites to stand by the waters",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:8": "And it came to pass that king Lamoni inquired of his servants,",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:9": "And they said unto him: Behold, he is feeding thy horses. Now the",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:10": "Now when king Lamoni heard that Ammon was preparing his horses",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:11": "Now I surely know that this is the Great Spirit, and I would",

  "The Son Of Alma 18:13": "And one of the king’s servants said unto him, Rabbanah, which is,",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:14": "Therefore Ammon turned himself unto the king, and said unto him:",

  "The Son Of Alma 18:17": "I say unto you, what is it, that thy marvelings are so great?",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:18": "Now when the king had heard these words, he marveled again, for",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:19": "Ammon answered and said unto him: I am not.",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:20": "And the king said: How knowest thou the thoughts of my heart?",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:21": "And now, if thou wilt tell me concerning these things, whatsoever",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:22": "Now Ammon being wise, yet harmless, he said unto Lamoni: Wilt",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:23": "And the king answered him, and said: Yea, I will believe all thy",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:24": "And Ammon began to speak unto him with boldness, and said unto",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:25": "And he answered, and said unto him: I do not know what that",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:26": "And then Ammon said: Believest thou that there is a Great Spirit?",

  "The Son Of Alma 18:28": "And Ammon said: This is God. And Ammon said unto him again:",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:29": "And he said: Yea, I believe that he created all things which are",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:30": "And Ammon said unto him: The heavens is a place where God dwells",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:31": "And king Lamoni said: Is it above the earth?",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:32": "And Ammon said: Yea, and he looketh down upon all the children of",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:33": "And king Lamoni said: I believe all these things which thou hast",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:34": "Ammon said unto him: I am a man; and man in the beginning was",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:35": "And a portion of that Spirit dwelleth in me, which giveth me",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:36": "Now when Ammon had said these words, he began at the creation of",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:37": "And he also rehearsed unto them (for it was unto the king and to",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:38": "And he also rehearsed unto them concerning the rebellions of",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:39": "But this is not all; for he expounded unto them the plan of",

  "The Son Of Alma 18:41": "And he began to cry unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, have mercy;",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:42": "And now, when he had said this, he fell unto the earth, as if he",
  "The Son Of Alma 18:43": "And it came to pass that his servants took him and carried him in",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:1": "And it came to pass that after two days and two nights they were",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:2": "Now the queen having heard of the fame of Ammon, therefore she",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:3": "And it came to pass that Ammon did as he was commanded, and went",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:4": "And she said unto him: The servants of my husband have made it",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:5": "Therefore, if this is the case, I would that ye should go in and",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:6": "Now, this was what Ammon desired, for he knew that king Lamoni was",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:7": "Therefore, what the queen desired of him was his only desire.",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:8": "And he said unto the queen: He is not dead, but he sleepeth in",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:9": "And Ammon said unto her: Believest thou this? And she said unto",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:10": "And Ammon said unto her: Blessed art thou because of thy",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:11": "And it came to pass that she watched over the bed of her husband,",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:12": "And it came to pass that he arose, according to the words of",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:13": "For as sure as thou livest, behold, I have seen my Redeemer; and",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:14": "Now Ammon seeing the Spirit of the Lord poured out according to",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:15": "Now, when the servants of the king had seen that they had fallen,",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:16": "And it came to pass that they did call on the name of the Lord,",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:17": "Thus, having been converted to the Lord, and never having made it",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:18": "And they began to assemble themselves together unto the house of",

  "The Son Of Alma 19:27": "And there were some who said that Ammon was sent by the Great",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:28": "And thus the contention began to be exceedingly sharp among them.",

  "The Son Of Alma 19:31": "And he, immediately, seeing the contention among his people, went",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:32": "But there were many among them who would not hear his words;",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:33": "And it came to pass that when Ammon arose he also administered",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:34": "And behold, many did declare unto the people that they had seen",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:35": "And it came to pass that there were many that did believe in",
  "The Son Of Alma 19:36": "And thus the work of the Lord did commence among the Lamanites;",
  "The Son Of Alma 20:1": "And it came to pass that when they had established a church in",
  "The Son Of Alma 20:2": "And the voice of the Lord came to Ammon saying: Thou shalt not go",
  "The Son Of Alma 20:3": "Now it came to pass that when Ammon had heard this, he said unto",
  "The Son Of Alma 20:4": "Now Lamoni said unto Ammon: I know, in the strength of the Lord",
  "The Son Of Alma 20:5": "And Ammon said unto him: No one hath told me, save it be God; and",
  "The Son Of Alma 20:6": "Now when Lamoni had heard this he caused that his servants should",
  "The Son Of Alma 20:7": "And he said unto Ammon: Come, I will go with thee down to the land",
  "The Son Of Alma 20:8": "And it came to pass that as Ammon and Lamoni were journeying",
  "The Son Of Alma 20:9": "And behold, the father of Lamoni said unto him: Why did ye not",
  "The Son Of Alma 20:10": "And he also said: Whither art thou going with this Nephite, who",
  "The Son Of Alma 20:11": "And it came to pass that Lamoni rehearsed unto him whither he was",
  "The Son Of Alma 20:12": "And he also told him all the cause of his tarrying in his own",
  "The Son Of Alma 20:13": "And now when Lamoni had rehearsed unto him all these things,",

  "The Son Of Alma 21:12": "And it came to pass that they saw that the people would harden",
  "The Son Of Alma 21:13": "Nevertheless, Aaron and a certain number of his brethren were",
  "The Son Of Alma 21:14": "And those who were cast into prison suffered many things, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 21:15": "And they went forth again to declare the word, and thus they were",
  "The Son Of Alma 21:16": "And they went forth whithersoever they were led by the Spirit of",

  "The Son Of Alma 22:4": "And Aaron said unto the king: Behold, the Spirit of the Lord has",
  "The Son Of Alma 22:5": "Now the king said unto them: What is this that ye have said",
  "The Son Of Alma 22:6": "And also, what is this that Ammon said—If ye will repent ye shall",
  "The Son Of Alma 22:7": "And Aaron answered him and said unto him: Believest thou that",
  "The Son Of Alma 22:8": "And now when Aaron heard this, his heart began to rejoice, and he",
  "The Son Of Alma 22:9": "And the king said: Is God that Great Spirit that brought our",
  "The Son Of Alma 22:10": "And Aaron said unto him: Yea, he is that Great Spirit, and he",
  "The Son Of Alma 22:11": "And he said: Yea, I believe that the Great Spirit created all",

  "The Son Of Alma 23:1": "Behold, now it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites sent a",
  "The Son Of Alma 23:2": "Yea, he sent a decree among them, that they should not lay their",
  "The Son Of Alma 23:3": "And thus they might go forth and preach the word according to",

  "The Son Of Alma 24:2": "And their hatred became exceedingly sore against them, even",
  "The Son Of Alma 24:3": "Now the king conferred the kingdom upon his son, and he called his",
  "The Son Of Alma 24:4": "And the king died in that selfsame year that the Lamanites began",
  "The Son Of Alma 24:5": "Now when Ammon and his brethren and all those who had come up with",
  "The Son Of Alma 24:6": "Now there was not one soul among all the people who had been",
  "The Son Of Alma 24:7": "Now, these are the words which he said unto the people concerning",
  "The Son Of Alma 24:8": "And behold, I thank my great God that he has given us a portion of",
  "The Son Of Alma 24:9": "And behold, I also thank my God, that by opening this",
  "The Son Of Alma 24:10": "And I also thank my God, yea, my great God, that he hath granted",

  "The Son Of Alma 24:17": "And now it came to pass that when the king had made an end of",
  "The Son Of Alma 24:19": "And thus we see that, when these Lamanites were brought to",
  "The Son Of Alma 24:20": "And it came to pass that their brethren, the Lamanites, made",
  "The Son Of Alma 24:21": "Now when the people saw that they were coming against them they",
  "The Son Of Alma 24:22": "And thus without meeting any resistance, they did slay a thousand",
  "The Son Of Alma 24:23": "Now when the Lamanites saw that their brethren would not flee",
  "The Son Of Alma 24:24": "Now when the Lamanites saw this they did forbear from slaying",
  "The Son Of Alma 24:25": "And it came to pass that they threw down their weapons of war,",
  "The Son Of Alma 24:26": "And it came to pass that the people of God were joined that day",
  "The Son Of Alma 24:27": "And there was not a wicked man slain among them; but there were",
  "The Son Of Alma 24:28": "Now the greatest number of those of the Lamanites who slew so",
  "The Son Of Alma 24:29": "Now, among those who joined the people of the Lord, there were",
  "The Son Of Alma 24:30": "And thus we can plainly discern, that after a people have been",
  "The Son Of Alma 25:1": "And behold, now it came to pass that those Lamanites were more",
  "The Son Of Alma 25:2": "But they took their armies and went over into the borders of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 25:3": "And after that, they had many battles with the Nephites, in the",
  "The Son Of Alma 25:4": "And among the Lamanites who were slain were almost all the seed of",
  "The Son Of Alma 25:5": "And the remainder, having fled into the east wilderness, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 25:6": "For many of them, after having suffered much loss and so many",
  "The Son Of Alma 25:7": "And it came to pass that those rulers who were the remnant of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 25:8": "Now this martyrdom caused that many of their brethren should be",
  "The Son Of Alma 25:9": "And behold they are hunted at this day by the Lamanites. Thus the",
  "The Son Of Alma 25:10": "For he said unto them: What ye shall do unto me shall be a type",
  "The Son Of Alma 25:11": "And now Abinadi was the first that suffered death by fire because",
  "The Son Of Alma 25:12": "And he said unto the priests of Noah that their seed should cause",
  "The Son Of Alma 25:13": "And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that they could",
  "The Son Of Alma 25:14": "And they did also bury their weapons of war, according as their",
  "The Son Of Alma 25:15": "Yea, and they did keep the law of Moses; for it was expedient",
  "The Son Of Alma 25:16": "Now they did not suppose that salvation came by the law of Moses;",
  "The Son Of Alma 25:17": "And now behold, Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni, and their",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:1": "And now, these are the words of Ammon to his brethren, which say",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:2": "And now, I ask, what great blessings has he bestowed upon us? Can",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:3": "Behold, I answer for you; for our brethren, the Lamanites, were in",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:4": "Behold, thousands of them do rejoice, and have been brought into",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:5": "Behold, the field was ripe, and blessed are ye, for ye did thrust",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:6": "Yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day;",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:7": "But behold, they are in the hands of the Lord of the harvest, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:8": "Blessed be the name of our God; let us sing to his praise, yea,",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:9": "For if we had not come up out of the land of Zarahemla, these our",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:10": "And it came to pass that when Ammon had said these words, his",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:11": "But Ammon said unto him: I do not boast in my own strength, nor",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:12": "Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak;",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:13": "Behold, how many thousands of our brethren has he loosed from the",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:14": "Yea, we have reason to praise him forever, for he is the Most",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:15": "Yea, they were encircled about with everlasting darkness and",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:16": "Therefore, let us glory, yea, we will glory in the Lord; yea, we",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:17": "Who could have supposed that our God would have been so merciful",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:18": "Behold, we went forth even in wrath, with mighty threatenings to",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:19": "Oh then, why did he not consign us to an awful destruction, yea,",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:20": "Oh, my soul, almost as it were, fleeth at the thought. Behold, he",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:21": "And now behold, my brethren, what natural man is there that",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:22": "Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith, and bringeth forth",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:23": "Now do ye remember, my brethren, that we said unto our brethren",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:24": "For they said unto us: Do ye suppose that ye can bring the",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:25": "And moreover they did say: Let us take up arms against them, that",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:26": "But behold, my beloved brethren, we came into the wilderness not",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:27": "Now when our hearts were depressed, and we were about to turn",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:28": "And now behold, we have come, and been forth amongst them; and we",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:29": "And we have entered into their houses and taught them, and we",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:30": "And we have suffered all manner of afflictions, and all this,",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:31": "Now behold, we can look forth and see the fruits of our labors;",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:32": "For behold, they had rather sacrifice their lives than even to",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:33": "And now behold I say unto you, has there been so great love in",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:34": "For behold, they would take up arms against their brethren; they",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:35": "Now have we not reason to rejoice? Yea, I say unto you, there",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:36": "Now if this is boasting, even so will I boast; for this is my",
  "The Son Of Alma 26:37": "Now my brethren, we see that God is mindful of every people,",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:1": "Now it came to pass that when those Lamanites who had gone to war",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:2": "And it came to pass that the Amalekites, because of their loss,",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:3": "Now this people again refused to take their arms, and they",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:4": "Now when Ammon and his brethren saw this work of destruction among",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:5": "Let us gather together this people of the Lord, and let us go down",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:6": "But the king said unto them: Behold, the Nephites will destroy us,",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:7": "And Ammon said: I will go and inquire of the Lord, and if he say",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:8": "And the king said unto him: Yea, if the Lord saith unto us go, we",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:9": "But Ammon said unto him: It is against the law of our brethren,",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:10": "But the king said unto him: Inquire of the Lord, and if he saith",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:11": "And it came to pass that Ammon went and inquired of the Lord, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:12": "Get this people out of this land, that they perish not; for Satan",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:13": "And now it came to pass that Ammon went and told the king all the",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:14": "And they gathered together all their people, yea, all the people",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:15": "And it came to pass that Ammon said unto them: Behold, I and my",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:16": "And it came to pass that as Ammon was going forth into the land,",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:17": "Now the joy of Ammon was so great even that he was full; yea, he",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:18": "Now was not this exceeding joy? Behold, this is joy which none",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:19": "Now the joy of Alma in meeting his brethren was truly great, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:20": "And now it came to pass that Alma conducted his brethren back to",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:21": "And it came to pass that the chief judge sent a proclamation",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:22": "And it came to pass that the voice of the people came, saying:",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:23": "And behold, we will set our armies between the land Jershon and",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:24": "And now behold, this will we do unto our brethren, that they may",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:25": "Now, it came to pass that when Ammon had heard this, he returned",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:26": "And it came to pass that it did cause great joy among them. And",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:27": "And they were among the people of Nephi, and also numbered among",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:28": "And they did look upon shedding the blood of their brethren with",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:29": "Therefore, they would suffer death in the most aggravating and",
  "The Son Of Alma 27:30": "And thus they were a zealous and beloved people, a highly favored",
  "The Son Of Alma 28:1": "And now it came to pass that after the people of Ammon were",
  "The Son Of Alma 28:2": "And thus there was a tremendous battle; yea, even such an one as",
  "The Son Of Alma 28:3": "Yea, and also there was a tremendous slaughter among the people of",
  "The Son Of Alma 28:4": "And now this was a time that there was a great mourning and",
  "The Son Of Alma 28:5": "Yea, the cry of widows mourning for their husbands, and also of",
  "The Son Of Alma 28:6": "And now surely this was a sorrowful day; yea, a time of solemnity,",
  "The Son Of Alma 28:7": "And thus endeth the fifteenth year of the reign of the judges over",
  "The Son Of Alma 28:8": "And this is the account of Ammon and his brethren, their",
  "The Son Of Alma 28:9": "And this is the account of the wars and contentions among the",
  "The Son Of Alma 28:10": "And from the first year to the fifteenth has brought to pass the",
  "The Son Of Alma 28:11": "And the bodies of many thousands are laid low in the earth, while",
  "The Son Of Alma 28:12": "While many thousands of others truly mourn for the loss of their",
  "The Son Of Alma 28:13": "And thus we see how great the inequality of man is because of sin",
  "The Son Of Alma 28:14": "And thus we see the great call of diligence of men to labor in",
  "The Son Of Alma 29:1": "O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart,",
  "The Son Of Alma 29:2": "Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of",
  "The Son Of Alma 29:3": "But behold, I am a man, and do sin in my wish; for I ought to be",
  "The Son Of Alma 29:4": "I ought not to harrow up in my desires, the firm decree of a just",
  "The Son Of Alma 29:5": "Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men; he",
  "The Son Of Alma 29:6": "Now, seeing that I know these things, why should I desire more",
  "The Son Of Alma 29:7": "Why should I desire that I were an angel, that I could speak unto",
  "The Son Of Alma 29:8": "For behold, the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own",
  "The Son Of Alma 29:9": "I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in it. I",
  "The Son Of Alma 29:10": "And behold, when I see many of my brethren truly penitent, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 29:11": "Yea, and I also remember the captivity of my fathers; for I",
  "The Son Of Alma 29:12": "Yea, I have always remembered the captivity of my fathers; and",
  "The Son Of Alma 29:13": "Yea, and that same God did establish his church among them; yea,",
  "The Son Of Alma 29:14": "But I do not joy in my own success alone, but my joy is more full",
  "The Son Of Alma 29:15": "Behold, they have labored exceedingly, and have brought forth",
  "The Son Of Alma 29:16": "Now, when I think of the success of these my brethren my soul is",
  "The Son Of Alma 29:17": "And now may God grant unto these, my brethren, that they may sit",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:1": "Behold, now it came to pass that after the people of Ammon were",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:2": "Now their dead were not numbered because of the greatness of their",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:3": "Yea, and the people did observe to keep the commandments of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:4": "And thus the people did have no disturbance in all the sixteenth",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:5": "And it came to pass that in the commencement of the seventeenth",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:6": "But it came to pass in the latter end of the seventeenth year,",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:7": "Now there was no law against a man’s belief; for it was strictly",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:8": "For thus saith the scripture: Choose ye this day, whom ye will",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:9": "Now if a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:10": "But if he murdered he was punished unto death; and if he robbed",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:11": "For there was a law that men should be judged according to their",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:12": "And this Anti-Christ, whose name was Korihor, (and the law could",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:13": "O ye that are bound down under a foolish and a vain hope, why do",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:14": "Behold, these things which ye call prophecies, which ye say are",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:15": "How do ye know of their surety? Behold, ye cannot know of things",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:16": "Ye look forward and say that ye see a remission of your sins. But",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:17": "And many more such things did he say unto them, telling them that",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:18": "And thus he did preach unto them, leading away the hearts of",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:19": "Now this man went over to the land of Jershon also, to preach",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:20": "But behold they were more wise than many of the Nephites; for",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:21": "And it came to pass that he caused that he should be carried out",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:22": "And it came to pass that the high priest said unto him: Why do ye",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:23": "Now the high priest’s name was Giddonah. And Korihor said unto",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:24": "Ye say that this people is a free people. Behold, I say they are",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:25": "Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:26": "And ye also say that Christ shall come. But behold, I say that ye",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:27": "And thus ye lead away this people after the foolish traditions of",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:28": "Yea, they durst not make use of that which is their own lest they",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:29": "Now when the high priest and the chief judge saw the hardness of",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:30": "And it came to pass that when he was brought before Alma and the",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:31": "And he did rise up in great swelling words before Alma, and did",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:32": "Now Alma said unto him: Thou knowest that we do not glut",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:33": "And notwithstanding the many labors which I have performed in the",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:34": "And now, if we do not receive anything for our labors in the",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:35": "Then why sayest thou that we preach unto this people to get gain,",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:36": "And Korihor answered him, Yea.",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:37": "And then Alma said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God?",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:38": "And he answered, Nay.",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:39": "Now Alma said unto him: Will ye deny again that there is a God,",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:40": "And now what evidence have ye that there is no God, or that",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:41": "But, behold, I have all things as a testimony that these things",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:42": "Behold, I know that thou believest, but thou art possessed with a",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:43": "And now Korihor said unto Alma: If thou wilt show me a sign, that",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:44": "But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:45": "And yet do ye go about, leading away the hearts of this people,",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:46": "And now it came to pass that Alma said unto him: Behold, I am",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:47": "But behold, it is better that thy soul should be lost than that",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:48": "Now Korihor said unto him: I do not deny the existence of a God,",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:49": "Now Alma said unto him: This will I give unto thee for a sign,",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:50": "Now when Alma had said these words, Korihor was struck dumb, that",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:51": "And now when the chief judge saw this, he put forth his hand and",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:52": "And Korihor put forth his hand and wrote, saying: I know that I",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:53": "But behold, the devil hath deceived me; for he appeared unto me",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:54": "Now when he had said this, he besought that Alma should pray unto",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:55": "But Alma said unto him: If this curse should be taken from thee",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:56": "And it came to pass that the curse was not taken off of Korihor;",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:57": "Now the knowledge of what had happened unto Korihor was",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:58": "And it came to pass that they were all convinced of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:59": "And it came to pass that as he went forth among the people, yea,",
  "The Son Of Alma 30:60": "And thus we see the end of him who perverteth the ways of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:1": "Now it came to pass that after the end of Korihor, Alma having",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:2": "For it was the cause of great sorrow to Alma to know of iniquity",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:3": "Now the Zoramites had gathered themselves together in a land which",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:4": "Now the Nephites greatly feared that the Zoramites would enter",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:5": "And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:6": "Therefore he took Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner; and Himni he did",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:7": "Now the eldest of his sons he took not with him, and his name was",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:8": "Now the Zoramites were dissenters from the Nephites; therefore",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:9": "But they had fallen into great errors, for they would not observe",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:10": "Neither would they observe the performances of the church, to",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:11": "Yea, in fine, they did pervert the ways of the Lord in very many",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:12": "Now, when they had come into the land, behold, to their",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:13": "For they had a place built up in the center of their synagogue, a",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:14": "Therefore, whosoever desired to worship must go forth and stand",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:15": "Holy, holy God; we believe that thou art God, and we believe that",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:16": "Holy God, we believe that thou hast separated us from our",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:17": "But thou art the same yesterday, today, and forever; and thou",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:18": "And again we thank thee, O God, that we are a chosen and a holy",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:19": "Now it came to pass that after Alma and his brethren and his sons",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:20": "For behold, every man did go forth and offer up these same",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:21": "Now the place was called by them Rameumptom, which, being",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:22": "Now, from this stand they did offer up, every man, the selfsame",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:23": "Now, after the people had all offered up thanks after this",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:24": "Now when Alma saw this his heart was grieved; for he saw that",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:25": "Yea, and he also saw that their hearts were lifted up unto great",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:26": "And he lifted up his voice to heaven, and cried, saying: O, how",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:27": "Behold, O God, they cry unto thee, and yet their hearts are",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:28": "Behold, O my God, their costly apparel, and their ringlets, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:29": "Yea, and they say that thou hast made it known unto them that",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:30": "O Lord God, how long wilt thou suffer that such wickedness and",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:31": "O Lord, my heart is exceedingly sorrowful; wilt thou comfort my",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:32": "O Lord, wilt thou comfort my soul, and give unto me success, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:33": "Wilt thou grant unto them that they may have strength, that they",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:34": "O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:35": "Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious, and many of them are",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:36": "Now it came to pass that when Alma had said these words, that he",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:37": "And after that they did separate themselves one from another,",
  "The Son Of Alma 31:38": "And the Lord provided for them that they should hunger not,",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:1": "And it came to pass that they did go forth, and began to preach",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:2": "And it came to pass that after much labor among them, they began",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:3": "Therefore they were not permitted to enter into their synagogues",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:4": "Now, as Alma was teaching and speaking unto the people upon the",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:5": "And they came unto Alma; and the one who was the foremost among",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:6": "And now when Alma heard this, he turned him about, his face",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:7": "Therefore he did say no more to the other multitude; but he",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:8": "I behold that ye are lowly in heart; and if so, blessed are ye.",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:9": "Behold thy brother hath said, What shall we do?—for we are cast",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:10": "Behold I say unto you, do ye suppose that ye cannot worship God",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:11": "Moreover, I would ask, do ye suppose that ye must not worship God",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:12": "I say unto you, it is well that ye are cast out of your",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:13": "And now, because ye are compelled to be humble blessed are ye;",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:14": "And now, as I said unto you, that because ye were compelled to be",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:15": "Yea, he that truly humbleth himself, and repenteth of his sins,",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:16": "Therefore, blessed are they who humble themselves without being",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:17": "Yea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:18": "Now I ask, is this faith? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for if a",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:19": "And now, how much more cursed is he that knoweth the will of God",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:20": "Now of this thing ye must judge. Behold, I say unto you, that it",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:21": "And now as I said concerning faith—faith is not to have a perfect",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:22": "And now, behold, I say unto you, and I would that ye should",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:23": "And now, he imparteth his word by angels unto men, yea, not only",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:24": "And now, my beloved brethren, as ye have desired to know of me",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:25": "For I do not mean that ye all of you have been compelled to",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:26": "Now, as I said concerning faith—that it was not a perfect",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:27": "But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:28": "Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place,",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:29": "Now behold, would not this increase your faith? I say unto you,",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:30": "But behold, as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:31": "And now, behold, are ye sure that this is a good seed? I say unto",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:32": "Therefore, if a seed groweth it is good, but if it groweth not,",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:33": "And now, behold, because ye have tried the experiment, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:34": "And now, behold, is your knowledge perfect? Yea, your knowledge",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:35": "O then, is not this real? I say unto you, Yea, because it is",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:36": "Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither must ye lay aside your faith,",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:37": "And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say: Let us",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:38": "But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:39": "Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:40": "And thus, if ye will not nourish the word, looking forward with",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:41": "But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:42": "And because of your diligence and your faith and your patience",
  "The Son Of Alma 32:43": "Then, my brethren, ye shall reap the rewards of your faith, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:1": "Now after Alma had spoken these words, they sent forth unto him",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:2": "And Alma said unto them: Behold, ye have said that ye could not",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:3": "Do ye remember to have read what Zenos, the prophet of old, has",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:4": "For he said: Thou art merciful, O God, for thou hast heard my",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:5": "Yea, O God, and thou wast merciful unto me when I did cry unto",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:6": "And again, O God, when I did turn to my house thou didst hear me",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:7": "And when I did turn unto my closet, O Lord, and prayed unto thee,",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:8": "Yea, thou art merciful unto thy children when they cry unto thee,",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:9": "Yea, O God, thou hast been merciful unto me, and heard my cries in",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:10": "Yea, and thou hast also heard me when I have been cast out and",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:11": "And thou didst hear me because of mine afflictions and my",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:12": "And now Alma said unto them: Do ye believe those scriptures which",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:13": "Behold, if ye do, ye must believe what Zenos said; for, behold he",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:14": "Now behold, my brethren, I would ask if ye have read the",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:15": "For it is not written that Zenos alone spake of these things, but",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:16": "For behold, he said: Thou art angry, O Lord, with this people,",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:17": "And now, my brethren, ye see that a second prophet of old has",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:18": "But behold, this is not all; these are not the only ones who have",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:19": "Behold, he was spoken of by Moses; yea, and behold a type was",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:20": "But few understood the meaning of those things, and this because",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:21": "O my brethren, if ye could be healed by merely casting about your",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:22": "If so, wo shall come upon you; but if not so, then cast about",
  "The Son Of Alma 33:23": "And now, my brethren, I desire that ye shall plant this word in",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:1": "And now it came to pass that after Alma had spoken these words",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:2": "My brethren, I think that it is impossible that ye should be",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:3": "And as ye have desired of my beloved brother that he should make",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:4": "Yea, even that ye would have so much faith as even to plant the",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:5": "And we have beheld that the great question which is in your minds",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:6": "And ye also beheld that my brother has proved unto you, in many",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:7": "My brother has called upon the words of Zenos, that redemption",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:8": "And now, behold, I will testify unto you of myself that these",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:9": "For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:10": "For it is expedient that there should be a great and last",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:11": "Now there is not any man that can sacrifice his own blood which",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:12": "But the law requireth the life of him who hath murdered;",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:13": "Therefore, it is expedient that there should be a great and last",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:14": "And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:15": "And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:16": "And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:17": "Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:18": "Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty to save.",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:19": "Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him.",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:20": "Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:21": "Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:22": "Yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies.",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:23": "Yea, cry unto him against the devil, who is an enemy to all",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:24": "Cry unto him over the crops of your fields, that ye may prosper",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:25": "Cry over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase.",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:26": "But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets,",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:27": "Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:28": "And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:29": "Therefore, if ye do not remember to be charitable, ye are as",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:30": "And now, my brethren, I would that, after ye have received so",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:31": "Yea, I would that ye would come forth and harden not your hearts",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:32": "For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God;",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:33": "And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:34": "Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:35": "For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:36": "And this I know, because the Lord hath said he dwelleth not in",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:37": "And now, my beloved brethren, I desire that ye should remember",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:38": "That ye contend no more against the Holy Ghost, but that ye",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:39": "Yea, and I also exhort you, my brethren, that ye be watchful unto",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:40": "And now my beloved brethren, I would exhort you to have patience,",
  "The Son Of Alma 34:41": "But that ye have patience, and bear with those afflictions, with",
  "The Son Of Alma 35:1": "Now it came to pass that after Amulek had made an end of these",
  "The Son Of Alma 35:2": "Yea, and the rest of the brethren, after they had preached the",
  "The Son Of Alma 35:3": "And it came to pass that after the more popular part of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 35:4": "And they sent and gathered together throughout all the land all",
  "The Son Of Alma 35:5": "Now their rulers and their priests and their teachers did not let",
  "The Son Of Alma 35:6": "And it came to pass that after they had found out the minds of all",
  "The Son Of Alma 35:7": "And it came to pass that Alma and his brethren did minister unto",
  "The Son Of Alma 35:8": "Now the people of the Zoramites were angry with the people of",
  "The Son Of Alma 35:9": "And he breathed out many threatenings against them. And now the",
  "The Son Of Alma 35:10": "Now this did stir up the Zoramites to anger against the people of",
  "The Son Of Alma 35:11": "And thus the Zoramites and the Lamanites began to make",
  "The Son Of Alma 35:12": "And thus ended the seventeenth year of the reign of the judges",
  "The Son Of Alma 35:13": "And the people of Ammon departed out of the land of Jershon, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 35:14": "And Alma, and Ammon, and their brethren, and also the two sons of",
  "The Son Of Alma 35:15": "Now Alma, being grieved for the iniquity of his people, yea for",
  "The Son Of Alma 35:16": "Therefore, he caused that his sons should be gathered together,",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:1": "My son, give ear to my words; for I swear unto you, that inasmuch",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:2": "I would that ye should do as I have done, in remembering the",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:3": "And now, O my son Helaman, behold, thou art in thy youth, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:4": "And I would not that ye think that I know of myself—not of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:5": "Now, behold, I say unto you, if I had not been born of God I",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:6": "For I went about with the sons of Mosiah, seeking to destroy the",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:7": "And behold, he spake unto us, as it were the voice of thunder, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:8": "But behold, the voice said unto me: Arise. And I arose and stood",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:9": "And he said unto me: If thou wilt of thyself be destroyed, seek no",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:10": "And it came to pass that I fell to the earth; and it was for the",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:11": "And the angel spake more things unto me, which were heard by my",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:12": "But I was racked with eternal torment, for my soul was harrowed",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:13": "Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:14": "Yea, and I had murdered many of his children, or rather led them",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:15": "Oh, thought I, that I could be banished and become extinct both",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:16": "And now, for three days and for three nights was I racked, even",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:17": "And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:18": "Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:19": "And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:20": "And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:21": "Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:22": "Yea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, God sitting",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:23": "But behold, my limbs did receive their strength again, and I",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:24": "Yea, and from that time even until now, I have labored without",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:25": "Yea, and now behold, O my son, the Lord doth give me exceedingly",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:26": "For because of the word which he has imparted unto me, behold,",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:27": "And I have been supported under trials and troubles of every",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:28": "And I know that he will raise me up at the last day, to dwell",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:29": "Yea, and he has also brought our fathers out of the land of",
  "The Son Of Alma 36:30": "But behold, my son, this is not all; for ye ought to know as I do",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:1": "And now, my son Helaman, I command you that ye take the records",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:2": "And I also command you that ye keep a record of this people,",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:3": "And these plates of brass, which contain these engravings, which",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:4": "Behold, it has been prophesied by our fathers, that they should be",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:5": "And now behold, if they are kept they must retain their",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:6": "Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:7": "And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:8": "And now, it has hitherto been wisdom in God that these things",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:9": "Yea, I say unto you, were it not for these things that these",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:10": "And who knoweth but what they will be the means of bringing many",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:11": "Now these mysteries are not yet fully made known unto me;",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:12": "And it may suffice if I only say they are preserved for a wise",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:13": "O remember, remember, my son Helaman, how strict are the",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:14": "And now remember, my son, that God has entrusted you with these",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:15": "And now behold, I tell you by the spirit of prophecy, that if ye",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:16": "But if ye keep the commandments of God, and do with these things",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:17": "For he will fulfil all his promises which he shall make unto you,",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:18": "For he promised unto them that he would preserve these things for",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:19": "And now behold, one purpose hath he fulfilled, even to the",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:20": "Therefore I command you, my son Helaman, that ye be diligent in",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:21": "And now, I will speak unto you concerning those twenty-four",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:22": "For behold, the Lord saw that his people began to work in",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:23": "And the Lord said: I will prepare unto my servant Gazelem, a",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:24": "And now, my son, these interpreters were prepared that the word",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:25": "I will bring forth out of darkness unto light all their secret",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:26": "And now, my son, we see that they did not repent; therefore they",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:27": "And now, my son, I command you that ye retain all their oaths,",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:28": "For behold, there is a curse upon all this land, that destruction",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:29": "Therefore ye shall keep these secret plans of their oaths and",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:30": "For behold, they murdered all the prophets of the Lord who came",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:31": "Yea, and cursed be the land forever and ever unto those workers",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:32": "And now, my son, remember the words which I have spoken unto you;",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:33": "Preach unto them repentance, and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ;",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:34": "Teach them to never be weary of good works, but to be meek and",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:35": "O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:36": "Yea, and cry unto God for all thy support; yea, let all thy",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:37": "Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:38": "And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the thing",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:39": "And behold, there cannot any man work after the manner of so",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:40": "And it did work for them according to their faith in God;",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:41": "Nevertheless, because those miracles were worked by small means",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:42": "Therefore, they tarried in the wilderness, or did not travel a",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:43": "And now, my son, I would that ye should understand that these",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:44": "For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ,",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:45": "And now I say, is there not a type in this thing? For just as",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:46": "O my son, do not let us be slothful because of the easiness of",
  "The Son Of Alma 37:47": "And now, my son, see that ye take care of these sacred things,",
  "The Son Of Alma 38:1": "My son, give ear to my words, for I say unto you, even as I said",
  "The Son Of Alma 38:2": "And now, my son, I trust that I shall have great joy in you,",
  "The Son Of Alma 38:3": "I say unto you, my son, that I have had great joy in thee already,",
  "The Son Of Alma 38:4": "For I know that thou wast in bonds; yea, and I also know that thou",
  "The Son Of Alma 38:5": "And now my son, Shiblon, I would that ye should remember, that as",
  "The Son Of Alma 38:6": "Now, my son, I would not that ye should think that I know these",
  "The Son Of Alma 38:7": "But behold, the Lord in his great mercy sent his angel to declare",
  "The Son Of Alma 38:8": "And it came to pass that I was three days and three nights in the",
  "The Son Of Alma 38:9": "And now, my son, I have told you this that ye may learn wisdom,",
  "The Son Of Alma 38:10": "And now, as ye have begun to teach the word even so I would that",
  "The Son Of Alma 38:11": "See that ye are not lifted up unto pride; yea, see that ye do not",
  "The Son Of Alma 38:12": "Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also see that ye bridle",
  "The Son Of Alma 38:13": "Do not pray as the Zoramites do, for ye have seen that they pray",
  "The Son Of Alma 38:14": "Do not say: O God, I thank thee that we are better than our",
  "The Son Of Alma 38:15": "And may the Lord bless your soul, and receive you at the last day",
  "The Son Of Alma 39:1": "And now, my son, I have somewhat more to say unto thee than what I",
  "The Son Of Alma 39:2": "For thou didst not give so much heed unto my words as did thy",
  "The Son Of Alma 39:3": "And this is not all, my son. Thou didst do that which was grievous",
  "The Son Of Alma 39:4": "Yea, she did steal away the hearts of many; but this was no excuse",
  "The Son Of Alma 39:5": "Know ye not, my son, that these things are an abomination in the",
  "The Son Of Alma 39:6": "For behold, if ye deny the Holy Ghost when it once has had place",
  "The Son Of Alma 39:7": "And now, my son, I would to God that ye had not been guilty of so",
  "The Son Of Alma 39:8": "But behold, ye cannot hide your crimes from God; and except ye",
  "The Son Of Alma 39:9": "Now my son, I would that ye should repent and forsake your sins,",
  "The Son Of Alma 39:10": "And I command you to take it upon you to counsel with your elder",
  "The Son Of Alma 39:11": "Suffer not yourself to be led away by any vain or foolish thing;",
  "The Son Of Alma 39:12": "And now the Spirit of the Lord doth say unto me: Command thy",
  "The Son Of Alma 39:13": "That ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might, and strength;",
  "The Son Of Alma 39:14": "Seek not after riches nor the vain things of this world; for",
  "The Son Of Alma 39:15": "And now, my son, I would say somewhat unto you concerning the",
  "The Son Of Alma 39:16": "And now, my son, this was the ministry unto which ye were called,",
  "The Son Of Alma 39:17": "And now I will ease your mind somewhat on this subject. Behold,",
  "The Son Of Alma 39:18": "Is it not as necessary that the plan of redemption should be made",
  "The Son Of Alma 39:19": "Is it not as easy at this time for the Lord to send his angel to",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:1": "Now my son, here is somewhat more I would say unto thee; for I",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:2": "Behold, I say unto you, that there is no resurrection—or, I would",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:3": "Behold, he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead. But",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:4": "Behold, there is a time appointed that all shall come forth from",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:5": "Now, whether there shall be one time, or a second time, or a third",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:6": "Now there must needs be a space betwixt the time of death and the",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:7": "And now I would inquire what becometh of the souls of men from",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:8": "Now whether there is more than one time appointed for men to rise",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:9": "Therefore, there is a time appointed unto men that they shall rise",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:10": "And when the time cometh when all shall rise, then shall they",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:11": "Now, concerning the state of the soul between death and the",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:12": "And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of those who are",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:13": "And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of the wicked,",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:14": "Now this is the state of the souls of the wicked, yea, in",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:15": "Now, there are some that have understood that this state of",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:16": "And behold, again it hath been spoken, that there is a first",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:17": "Now, we do not suppose that this first resurrection, which is",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:18": "Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but it meaneth the reuniting of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:19": "Now, whether the souls and the bodies of those of whom has been",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:20": "Now, my son, I do not say that their resurrection cometh at the",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:21": "But whether it be at his resurrection or after, I do not say; but",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:22": "Yea, this bringeth about the restoration of those things of which",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:23": "The soul shall be restored to the body, and the body to the soul;",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:24": "And now, my son, this is the restoration of which has been spoken",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:25": "And then shall the righteous shine forth in the kingdom of God.",
  "The Son Of Alma 40:26": "But behold, an awful death cometh upon the wicked; for they die",
  "The Son Of Alma 41:1": "And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the restoration",
  "The Son Of Alma 41:2": "I say unto thee, my son, that the plan of restoration is requisite",
  "The Son Of Alma 41:3": "And it is requisite with the justice of God that men should be",
  "The Son Of Alma 41:4": "And if their works are evil they shall be restored unto them for",
  "The Son Of Alma 41:5": "The one raised to happiness according to his desires of happiness,",
  "The Son Of Alma 41:6": "And so it is on the other hand. If he hath repented of his sins,",
  "The Son Of Alma 41:7": "These are they that are redeemed of the Lord; yea, these are they",
  "The Son Of Alma 41:8": "Now, the decrees of God are unalterable; therefore, the way is",
  "The Son Of Alma 41:9": "And now behold, my son, do not risk one more offense against your",
  "The Son Of Alma 41:10": "Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning",
  "The Son Of Alma 41:11": "And now, my son, all men that are in a state of nature, or I",
  "The Son Of Alma 41:12": "And now behold, is the meaning of the word restoration to take a",
  "The Son Of Alma 41:13": "O, my son, this is not the case; but the meaning of the word",
  "The Son Of Alma 41:14": "Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful unto your brethren;",
  "The Son Of Alma 41:15": "For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:1": "And now, my son, I perceive there is somewhat more which doth",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:2": "Now behold, my son, I will explain this thing unto thee. For",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:3": "Now, we see that the man had become as God, knowing good and evil;",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:4": "And thus we see, that there was a time granted unto man to repent,",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:5": "For behold, if Adam had put forth his hand immediately, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:6": "But behold, it was appointed unto man to die—therefore, as they",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:7": "And now, ye see by this that our first parents were cut off both",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:8": "Now behold, it was not expedient that man should be reclaimed from",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:9": "Therefore, as the soul could never die, and the fall had brought",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:10": "Therefore, as they had become carnal, sensual, and devilish, by",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:11": "And now remember, my son, if it were not for the plan of",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:12": "And now, there was no means to reclaim men from this fallen",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:13": "Therefore, according to justice, the plan of redemption could not",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:14": "And thus we see that all mankind were fallen, and they were in",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:15": "And now, the plan of mercy could not be brought about except an",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:16": "Now, repentance could not come unto men except there were a",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:17": "Now, how could a man repent except he should sin? How could he",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:18": "Now, there was a punishment affixed, and a just law given, which",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:19": "Now, if there was no law given—if a man murdered he should",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:20": "And also, if there was no law given against sin men would not be",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:21": "And if there was no law given, if men sinned what could justice",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:22": "But there is a law given, and a punishment affixed, and a",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:23": "But God ceaseth not to be God, and mercy claimeth the penitent,",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:24": "For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also mercy",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:25": "What, do ye suppose that mercy can rob justice? I say unto you,",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:26": "And thus God bringeth about his great and eternal purposes, which",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:27": "Therefore, O my son, whosoever will come may come and partake of",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:28": "If he has desired to do evil, and has not repented in his days,",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:29": "And now, my son, I desire that ye should let these things trouble",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:30": "O my son, I desire that ye should deny the justice of God no",
  "The Son Of Alma 42:31": "And now, O my son, ye are called of God to preach the word unto",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:1": "And now it came to pass that the sons of Alma did go forth among",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:2": "Now we shall say no more concerning their preaching, except that",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:3": "And now I return to an account of the wars between the Nephites",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:4": "For behold, it came to pass that the Zoramites became Lamanites;",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:5": "And it came to pass that the Lamanites came with their thousands;",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:6": "And now, as the Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:7": "Now this he did that he might preserve their hatred towards the",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:8": "For behold, his designs were to stir up the Lamanites to anger",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:9": "And now the design of the Nephites was to support their lands, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:10": "For they knew that if they should fall into the hands of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:11": "Yea, and they also knew the extreme hatred of the Lamanites",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:12": "And the Nephites would not suffer that they should be destroyed;",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:13": "And the people of Ammon did give unto the Nephites a large",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:14": "Now those descendants were as numerous, nearly, as were the",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:15": "And it came to pass as the armies of the Lamanites had gathered",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:16": "Now, the leader of the Nephites, or the man who had been",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:17": "And Moroni took all the command, and the government of their",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:18": "And it came to pass that he met the Lamanites in the borders of",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:19": "And when the armies of the Lamanites saw that the people of",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:20": "Now the army of Zerahemnah was not prepared with any such thing;",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:21": "But they were not armed with breastplates, nor shields—therefore,",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:22": "Behold, now it came to pass that they durst not come against the",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:23": "But it came to pass, as soon as they had departed into the",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:24": "And it came to pass that the word of the Lord came unto Alma, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:25": "Now Moroni, leaving a part of his army in the land of Jershon,",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:26": "And he caused that all the people in that quarter of the land",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:27": "And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his army should be",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:28": "And Moroni placed spies round about, that he might know when the",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:29": "And now, as Moroni knew the intention of the Lamanites, that it",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:30": "And he also knowing that it was the only desire of the Nephites",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:31": "Therefore, he divided his army and brought a part over into the",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:32": "And the remainder he concealed in the west valley, on the west of",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:33": "And thus having placed his army according to his desire, he was",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:34": "And it came to pass that the Lamanites came up on the north of",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:35": "And as the Lamanites had passed the hill Riplah, and came into",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:36": "And it came to pass that the Lamanites, when they saw the",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:37": "And the work of death commenced on both sides, but it was more",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:38": "While on the other hand, there was now and then a man fell among",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:39": "And it came to pass that the Lamanites became frightened, because",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:40": "And they were pursued by Lehi and his men; and they were driven",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:41": "And it came to pass that Moroni and his army met the Lamanites in",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:42": "And the Lamanites did flee again before them, towards the land of",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:43": "Now in this case the Lamanites did fight exceedingly; yea, never",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:44": "And they were inspired by the Zoramites and the Amalekites, who",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:45": "Nevertheless, the Nephites were inspired by a better cause, for",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:46": "And they were doing that which they felt was the duty which they",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:47": "And again, the Lord has said that: Ye shall defend your families",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:48": "And it came to pass that when the men of Moroni saw the",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:49": "And it came to pass that they turned upon the Lamanites, and they",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:50": "And they began to stand against the Lamanites with power; and in",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:51": "Now, the Lamanites were more numerous, yea, by more than double",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:52": "Therefore the armies of Moroni encircled them about, yea, even on",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:53": "Therefore when Zerahemnah saw the men of Lehi on the east of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 43:54": "Now Moroni, when he saw their terror, commanded his men that they",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:1": "And it came to pass that they did stop and withdrew a pace from",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:2": "Behold, we have not come out to battle against you that we might",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:3": "But now, ye behold that the Lord is with us; and ye behold that he",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:4": "Now ye see that this is the true faith of God; yea, ye see that",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:5": "And now, Zerahemnah, I command you, in the name of that",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:6": "Yea, and this is not all; I command you by all the desires which",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:7": "And now, if ye do not this, behold, ye are in our hands, and I",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:8": "And now it came to pass that when Zerahemnah had heard these",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:9": "Behold, we are not of your faith; we do not believe that it is God",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:10": "And now when Zerahemnah had made an end of speaking these words,",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:11": "Now I cannot recall the words which I have spoken, therefore as",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:12": "And now when Moroni had said these words, Zerahemnah retained his",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:13": "And it came to pass that the soldier who stood by, who smote off",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:14": "Even as this scalp has fallen to the earth, which is the scalp of",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:15": "Now there were many, when they heard these words and saw the",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:16": "Now it came to pass that Zerahemnah was exceedingly wroth, and he",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:17": "And now Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:18": "But behold, their naked skins and their bare heads were exposed",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:19": "Now Zerahemnah, when he saw that they were all about to be",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:20": "And it came to pass that Moroni caused that the work of death",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:21": "Now the number of their dead was not numbered because of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:22": "And it came to pass that they did cast their dead into the waters",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:23": "And the armies of the Nephites, or of Moroni, returned and came",
  "The Son Of Alma 44:24": "And thus ended the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:1": "Behold, now it came to pass that the people of Nephi were",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:2": "And it came to pass in the nineteenth year of the reign of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:3": "And Helaman said unto him: Yea, I believe.",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:4": "And Alma said again: Believest thou in Jesus Christ, who shall",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:5": "And he said: Yea, I believe all the words which thou hast spoken.",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:6": "And Alma said unto him again: Will ye keep my commandments?",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:7": "And he said: Yea, I will keep thy commandments with all my heart.",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:8": "Then Alma said unto him: Blessed art thou; and the Lord shall",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:9": "But behold, I have somewhat to prophesy unto thee; but what I",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:10": "And these are the words: Behold, I perceive that this very",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:11": "Yea, and then shall they see wars and pestilences, yea, famines",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:12": "Yea, and this because they shall dwindle in unbelief and fall",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:13": "And when that great day cometh, behold, the time very soon cometh",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:14": "But whosoever remaineth, and is not destroyed in that great and",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:15": "And now it came to pass that after Alma had said these things to",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:16": "And he said: Thus saith the Lord God—Cursed shall be the land,",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:17": "And now, when Alma had said these words he blessed the church,",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:18": "And when Alma had done this he departed out of the land of",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:19": "Behold, this we know, that he was a righteous man; and the saying",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:20": "And now it came to pass in the commencement of the nineteenth",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:21": "For behold, because of their wars with the Lamanites and the many",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:22": "Therefore, Helaman and his brethren went forth to establish the",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:23": "And now it came to pass that after Helaman and his brethren had",
  "The Son Of Alma 45:24": "But they grew proud, being lifted up in their hearts, because of",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:1": "And it came to pass that as many as would not hearken to the words",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:2": "And now behold, they were exceedingly wroth, insomuch that they",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:3": "Now the leader of those who were wroth against their brethren was",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:4": "And Amalickiah was desirous to be a king; and those people who",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:5": "And they had been led by the flatteries of Amalickiah, that if",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:6": "Thus they were led away by Amalickiah to dissensions,",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:7": "And there were many in the church who believed in the flattering",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:8": "Thus we see how quick the children of men do forget the Lord their",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:9": "Yea, and we also see the great wickedness one very wicked man can",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:10": "Yea, we see that Amalickiah, because he was a man of cunning",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:11": "And now it came to pass that when Moroni, who was the chief",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:12": "And it came to pass that he rent his coat; and he took a piece",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:13": "And he fastened on his head-plate, and his breastplate, and his",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:14": "For thus were all the true believers of Christ, who belonged to",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:15": "And those who did belong to the church were faithful; yea, all",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:16": "And therefore, at this time, Moroni prayed that the cause of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:17": "And it came to pass that when he had poured out his soul to God,",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:18": "And he said: Surely God shall not suffer that we, who are",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:19": "And when Moroni had said these words, he went forth among the",

  "The Son Of Alma 46:23": "Moroni said unto them: Behold, we are a remnant of the seed of",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:24": "Yea, let us preserve our liberty as a remnant of Joseph; yea, let",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:25": "Now behold, this giveth my soul sorrow; nevertheless, my soul",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:26": "Now behold, this was the language of Jacob.",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:27": "And now who knoweth but what the remnant of the seed of Joseph,",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:28": "And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words he",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:29": "And it came to pass that when Amalickiah saw that the people of",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:30": "Now Moroni thought it was not expedient that the Lamanites should",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:31": "Therefore Moroni thought it was expedient that he should take his",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:32": "And it came to pass that he did according to his desires, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:33": "And it came to pass that Amalickiah fled with a small number of",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:34": "Now, Moroni being a man who was appointed by the chief judges and",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:35": "And it came to pass that whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:36": "And it came to pass also, that he caused the title of liberty to",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:37": "And they began to have peace again in the land; and thus they did",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:38": "And Helaman and the high priests did also maintain order in the",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:39": "And it came to pass that there were many who died, firmly",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:40": "And there were some who died with fevers, which at some seasons",
  "The Son Of Alma 46:41": "But there were many who died with old age; and those who died in",
  "The Son Of Alma 47:1": "Now we will return in our record to Amalickiah and those who had",
  "The Son Of Alma 47:2": "And it came to pass that when the proclamation had gone forth",
  "The Son Of Alma 47:3": "And now it came to pass that the king was wroth because of their",
  "The Son Of Alma 47:4": "Now behold, this was the desire of Amalickiah; for he being a very",
  "The Son Of Alma 47:5": "And now he had got the command of those parts of the Lamanites who",
  "The Son Of Alma 47:6": "And they had appointed a man to be a king and a leader over them,",
  "The Son Of Alma 47:7": "And it came to pass that they had gathered themselves together",
  "The Son Of Alma 47:8": "Now it was not Amalickiah’s intention to give them battle",
  "The Son Of Alma 47:9": "And behold, it came to pass that he caused his army to pitch their",
  "The Son Of Alma 47:10": "And it came to pass that when it was night he sent a secret",
  "The Son Of Alma 47:11": "And it came to pass that when Lehonti received the message he",
  "The Son Of Alma 47:12": "And it came to pass that when Amalickiah found that he could not",
  "The Son Of Alma 47:13": "And it came to pass that when Lehonti had come down with his",

  "The Son Of Alma 47:30": "And the army which pursued after them returned, having pursued",
  "The Son Of Alma 47:31": "And it came to pass on the morrow he entered the city Nephi with",
  "The Son Of Alma 47:32": "And now it came to pass that the queen, when she had heard that",
  "The Son Of Alma 47:33": "Therefore, when the queen had received this message she sent unto",
  "The Son Of Alma 47:34": "And it came to pass that Amalickiah took the same servant that",
  "The Son Of Alma 47:35": "And it came to pass that Amalickiah sought the favor of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 47:36": "Now these dissenters, having the same instruction and the same",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:1": "And now it came to pass that, as soon as Amalickiah had obtained",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:2": "And thus he did inspire their hearts against the Nephites,",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:3": "Therefore he had accomplished his design, for he had hardened the",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:4": "For he was determined, because of the greatness of the number of",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:5": "And thus he did appoint chief captains of the Zoramites, they",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:6": "And it came to pass that they took their camp, and moved forth",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:7": "Now it came to pass that while Amalickiah had thus been obtaining",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:8": "Yea, he had been strengthening the armies of the Nephites, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:9": "And in their weakest fortifications he did place the greater",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:10": "And thus he was preparing to support their liberty, their lands,",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:11": "And Moroni was a strong and a mighty man; he was a man of a",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:12": "Yea, a man whose heart did swell with thanksgiving to his God,",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:13": "Yea, and he was a man who was firm in the faith of Christ, and he",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:14": "Now the Nephites were taught to defend themselves against their",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:15": "And this was their faith, that by so doing God would prosper them",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:16": "And also, that God would make it known unto them whither they",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:17": "Yea, verily, verily I say unto you, if all men had been, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:18": "Behold, he was a man like unto Ammon, the son of Mosiah, yea, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:19": "Now behold, Helaman and his brethren were no less serviceable",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:20": "And thus they went forth, and the people did humble themselves",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:21": "But, as I have said, in the latter end of the nineteenth year,",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:22": "Yea, and in fine, their wars never did cease for the space of",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:23": "Now, they were sorry to take up arms against the Lamanites,",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:24": "Nevertheless, they could not suffer to lay down their lives, that",
  "The Son Of Alma 48:25": "Yea, they could not bear that their brethren should rejoice over",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:1": "And now it came to pass in the eleventh month of the nineteenth",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:2": "And behold, the city had been rebuilt, and Moroni had stationed an",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:3": "Behold, I said that the city of Ammonihah had been rebuilt. I say",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:4": "But behold, how great was their disappointment; for behold, the",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:5": "Now at this time the chief captains of the Lamanites were",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:6": "Now the leaders of the Lamanites had supposed, because of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:7": "And being thus prepared they supposed that they should easily",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:8": "But behold, to their uttermost astonishment, they were prepared",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:9": "And it came to pass that the Lamanites, or the Amalickiahites,",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:10": "Now, if king Amalickiah had come down out of the land of Nephi,",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:11": "But behold, Amalickiah did not come down himself to battle. And",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:12": "Therefore they retreated into the wilderness, and took their camp",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:13": "For they knew not that Moroni had fortified, or had built forts",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:14": "But behold, to their astonishment, the city of Noah, which had",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:15": "And now, behold, this was wisdom in Moroni; for he had supposed",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:16": "And behold, Moroni had appointed Lehi to be chief captain over",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:17": "And now behold it came to pass, that when the Lamanites had found",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:18": "Now behold, the Lamanites could not get into their forts of",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:19": "And thus were the Nephites prepared to destroy all such as should",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:20": "Thus they were prepared, yea, a body of their strongest men, with",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:21": "And it came to pass that the captains of the Lamanites brought up",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:22": "Now when they found that they could not obtain power over the",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:23": "Thus the Nephites had all power over their enemies; and thus the",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:24": "There were about fifty who were wounded, who had been exposed to",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:25": "And it came to pass, that when the Lamanites saw that their chief",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:26": "And it came to pass that he was exceedingly angry with his",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:27": "Yea, he was exceedingly wroth, and he did curse God, and also",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:28": "And it came to pass, that on the other hand, the people of Nephi",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:29": "And thus ended the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges",
  "The Son Of Alma 49:30": "Yea, and there was continual peace among them, and exceedingly",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:1": "And now it came to pass that Moroni did not stop making",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:2": "And upon the top of these ridges of earth he caused that there",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:3": "And he caused that upon those works of timbers there should be a",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:4": "And he caused towers to be erected that overlooked those works of",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:5": "And they were prepared that they could cast stones from the top",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:6": "Thus Moroni did prepare strongholds against the coming of their",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:7": "And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his armies should go",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:8": "And the land of Nephi did run in a straight course from the east",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:9": "And it came to pass that when Moroni had driven all the Lamanites",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:10": "And he also placed armies on the south, in the borders of their",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:11": "And thus he cut off all the strongholds of the Lamanites in the",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:12": "Thus Moroni, with his armies, which did increase daily because of",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:13": "And it came to pass that the Nephites began the foundation of a",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:14": "And they also began a foundation for a city between the city of",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:15": "And they also began in that same year to build many cities on the",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:16": "And thus ended the twentieth year.",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:17": "And in these prosperous circumstances were the people of Nephi in",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:18": "And they did prosper exceedingly, and they became exceedingly",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:19": "And thus we see how merciful and just are all the dealings of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:20": "Blessed art thou and thy children; and they shall be blessed,",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:21": "And we see that these promises have been verified to the people",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:22": "And those who were faithful in keeping the commandments of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:23": "But behold there never was a happier time among the people of",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:24": "And it came to pass that the twenty and second year of the reign",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:25": "And it came to pass that in the commencement of the twenty and",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:26": "For behold, the people who possessed the land of Morianton did",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:27": "But behold, the people who possessed the land of Lehi fled to the",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:28": "And it came to pass that when the people of Morianton, who were",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:29": "Therefore, Morianton put it into their hearts that they should",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:30": "And behold, they would have carried this plan into effect, (which",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:31": "And it came to pass that she fled, and came over to the camp of",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:32": "Now behold, the people who were in the land Bountiful, or rather",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:33": "Therefore Moroni sent an army, with their camp, to head the",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:34": "And it came to pass that they did not head them until they had",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:35": "And it came to pass that the army which was sent by Moroni, which",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:36": "And thus were the people of Morianton brought back. And upon",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:37": "And it came to pass that in the same year that the people of",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:38": "Nevertheless, he had refused Alma to take possession of those",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:39": "Behold, it came to pass that the son of Nephihah was appointed to",
  "The Son Of Alma 50:40": "Now behold, his name was Pahoran. And Pahoran did fill the seat",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:1": "And now it came to pass in the commencement of the twenty and",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:2": "Nevertheless, they did not long maintain an entire peace in the",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:3": "But behold, Pahoran would not alter nor suffer the law to be",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:4": "Therefore, those who were desirous that the law should be altered",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:5": "And it came to pass that those who were desirous that Pahoran",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:6": "And those who were desirous that Pahoran should remain chief judge",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:7": "And it came to pass that this matter of their contention was",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:8": "Now those who were in favor of kings were those of high birth, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:9": "But behold, this was a critical time for such contentions to be",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:10": "But behold, we shall see that his promise which he made was rash;",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:11": "Now his armies were not so great as they had hitherto been,",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:12": "Yea, even Amalickiah did himself come down, at the head of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:13": "And it came to pass that when the men who were called king-men",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:14": "And it came to pass that when Moroni saw this, and also saw that",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:15": "And it came to pass that he sent a petition, with the voice of",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:16": "For it was his first care to put an end to such contentions and",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:17": "And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that his army should go",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:18": "And it came to pass that the armies did march forth against them;",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:19": "And it came to pass that there were four thousand of those",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:20": "And the remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:21": "And thus Moroni put an end to those king-men, that there were not",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:22": "Behold, it came to pass that while Moroni was thus breaking down",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:23": "And it came to pass that the Nephites were not sufficiently",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:24": "And those who fled out of the city of Moroni came to the city of",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:25": "But it came to pass that Amalickiah would not suffer the",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:26": "And thus he went on, taking possession of many cities, the city",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:27": "And thus had the Lamanites obtained, by the cunning of",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:28": "And it came to pass that they marched to the borders of the land",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:29": "But it came to pass that they were met by Teancum, who had slain",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:30": "And it came to pass that he headed Amalickiah also, as he was",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:31": "But behold he met with a disappointment by being repulsed by",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:32": "And it came to pass that they did harass them, insomuch that they",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:33": "And it came to pass that when the night had come, Teancum and his",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:34": "And it came to pass that Teancum stole privily into the tent of",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:35": "And he returned again privily to his own camp, and behold, his",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:36": "And he caused that his armies should stand in readiness, lest the",
  "The Son Of Alma 51:37": "And thus endeth the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:1": "And now, it came to pass in the twenty and sixth year of the reign",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:2": "And now, when the Lamanites saw this they were affrighted; and",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:3": "And it came to pass that the brother of Amalickiah was appointed",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:4": "And it came to pass that he did command that his people should",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:5": "And now, Teancum saw that the Lamanites were determined to",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:6": "But he kept his men round about, as if making preparations for",

  "The Son Of Alma 52:8": "And Moroni also sent orders unto him that he should retain all the",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:9": "And he also sent orders unto him that he should fortify the land",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:10": "And Moroni also sent unto him, desiring him that he would be",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:11": "And he also said unto him, I would come unto you, but behold, the",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:12": "Now, the king (Ammoron) had departed out of the land of",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:13": "And thus he was endeavoring to harass the Nephites, and to draw",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:14": "And thus were the Nephites in those dangerous circumstances in",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:15": "But behold, it came to pass in the twenty and seventh year of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:16": "And it came to pass that Teancum had received orders to make an",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:17": "And it came to pass that Teancum made preparations to make an",

  "The Son Of Alma 52:20": "And it came to pass they sent embassies to the army of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:21": "And it came to pass that Moroni, having no hopes of meeting them",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:22": "Therefore he caused that Teancum should take a small number of",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:23": "And it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites did march",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:24": "And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that he began to",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:25": "And thus they did, and slew all those who had been left to",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:26": "And thus Moroni had obtained possession of the city Mulek with a",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:27": "And it came to pass that the Lamanites did pursue Teancum until",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:28": "And now behold, when the chief captains of the Lamanites had",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:29": "Now the Lamanites did not know that Moroni had been in their rear",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:30": "Now Lehi was not desirous to overtake them till they should meet",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:31": "And it came to pass that before the Lamanites had retreated far",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:32": "And Moroni commanded his men that they should fall upon them",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:33": "And it came to pass that Jacob, being their leader, being also a",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:34": "Moroni being in their course of march, therefore Jacob was",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:35": "And it came to pass that they fought on both hands with exceeding",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:36": "And Lehi pressed upon their rear with such fury with his strong",
  "The Son Of Alma 52:37": "Now Moroni seeing their confusion, he said unto them: If ye will",

  "The Son Of Alma 53:8": "And now it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites, on the",
  "The Son Of Alma 53:9": "And thus because of iniquity amongst themselves, yea, because of",
  "The Son Of Alma 53:10": "And now behold, I have somewhat to say concerning the people of",
  "The Son Of Alma 53:11": "And because of their oath they had been kept from taking up arms",
  "The Son Of Alma 53:12": "And for this cause they were brought down into the land of",

  "The Son Of Alma 54:13": "Behold, I am in my anger, and also my people; ye have sought to",
  "The Son Of Alma 54:14": "Now I close my epistle. I am Moroni; I am a leader of the people",
  "The Son Of Alma 54:15": "Now it came to pass that Ammoron, when he had received this",
  "The Son Of Alma 54:16": "I am Ammoron, the king of the Lamanites; I am the brother of",
  "The Son Of Alma 54:17": "For behold, your fathers did wrong their brethren, insomuch that",
  "The Son Of Alma 54:18": "And now behold, if ye will lay down your arms, and subject",
  "The Son Of Alma 54:19": "Behold, ye have breathed out many threatenings against me and my",
  "The Son Of Alma 54:20": "Nevertheless, I will grant to exchange prisoners according to",
  "The Son Of Alma 54:21": "And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold,",
  "The Son Of Alma 54:22": "And if it so be that there is a devil and a hell, behold will he",
  "The Son Of Alma 54:23": "I am Ammoron, and a descendant of Zoram, whom your fathers",
  "The Son Of Alma 54:24": "And behold now, I am a bold Lamanite; behold, this war hath been",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:1": "Now it came to pass that when Moroni had received this epistle he",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:2": "And he said: Behold, I will not exchange prisoners with Ammoron",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:3": "Behold, I know the place where the Lamanites do guard my people",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:4": "And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words, he",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:5": "And it came to pass that they found one, whose name was Laman; and",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:6": "Now Moroni caused that Laman and a small number of his men should",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:7": "Now the Nephites were guarded in the city of Gid; therefore Moroni",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:8": "And when it was evening Laman went to the guards who were over the",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:9": "Now when the Lamanites heard these words they received him with",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:10": "But Laman said unto them: Let us keep of our wine till we go",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:11": "For, said they: We are weary, therefore let us take of the wine,",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:12": "And Laman said unto them: You may do according to your desires.",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:13": "And it came to pass that they did take of the wine freely; and it",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:14": "And it came to pass they did drink and were merry, and by and by",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:15": "And now when Laman and his men saw that they were all drunken,",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:16": "And now this was according to the design of Moroni. And Moroni",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:17": "Yea, even to their women, and all those of their children, as",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:18": "But had they awakened the Lamanites, behold they were drunken and",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:19": "But behold, this was not the desire of Moroni; he did not delight",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:20": "But he had obtained his desires; for he had armed those prisoners",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:21": "And then he caused the men who were with him to withdraw a pace",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:22": "Now behold this was done in the night-time, so that when the",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:23": "And thus they saw that the Nephites had power over them; and in",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:24": "Now behold, this was the desire of Moroni. He took them prisoners",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:25": "And it came to pass that he did cause the Lamanites, whom he had",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:26": "And it came to pass that when he had fortified the city Gid,",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:27": "And it came to pass that they did, notwithstanding all the",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:28": "And it came to pass that the Nephites began again to be",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:29": "Many time did the Lamanites attempt to encircle them about by",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:30": "And many times did they attempt to administer of their wine to",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:31": "But behold, the Nephites were not slow to remember the Lord their",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:32": "And they were thus cautious that no poison should be administered",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:33": "And now it came to pass that it was expedient for Moroni to make",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:34": "And they were continually bringing new forces into that city, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 55:35": "And thus ended the twenty and ninth year of the reign of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:1": "And now it came to pass in the commencement of the thirtieth year",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:2": "And these are the words which he wrote, saying: My dearly beloved",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:3": "Behold, two thousand of the sons of those men whom Ammon brought",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:4": "Now I need not rehearse unto you concerning their traditions or",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:5": "Therefore it sufficeth me that I tell you that two thousand of",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:6": "And now ye also know concerning the covenant which their fathers",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:7": "But in the twenty and sixth year, when they saw our afflictions",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:8": "But I would not suffer them that they should break this covenant",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:9": "But behold, here is one thing in which we may have great joy. For",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:10": "And I did join my two thousand sons, (for they are worthy to be",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:11": "Nevertheless, we may console ourselves in this point, that they",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:12": "And the Lamanites had also retained many prisoners, all of whom",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:13": "And now these are the cities of which the Lamanites have obtained",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:14": "The land of Manti, or the city of Manti, and the city of Zeezrom,",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:15": "And these are the cities which they possessed when I arrived at",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:16": "Yea, and they were depressed in body as well as in spirit, for",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:17": "And now they were determined to conquer in this place or die;",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:18": "And now it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that Antipus",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:19": "And thus were we favored of the Lord; for had they come upon us",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:20": "They were commanded by Ammoron to maintain those cities which",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:21": "Now we were desirous that the Lamanites should come upon us; for",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:22": "And it came to pass that we kept spies out round about, to watch",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:23": "For we knew in those cities they were not sufficiently strong to",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:24": "They durst not pass by us with their whole army, neither durst",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:25": "Neither durst they march down against the city of Zarahemla;",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:26": "And thus, with their forces, they were determined to maintain",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:27": "And now it came to pass in the second month of this year, there",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:28": "And also there were sent two thousand men unto us from the land",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:29": "And the Lamanites, thus seeing our forces increase daily, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:30": "Now when we saw that the Lamanites began to grow uneasy on this",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:31": "And we were to march near the city of Antiparah, as if we were",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:32": "And it came to pass that we did march forth, as if with our",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:33": "And it came to pass that Antipus did march forth with a part of",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:34": "And now, in the city Antiparah were stationed the strongest army",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:35": "And it came to pass that when they had been informed by their",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:36": "And it came to pass that we did flee before them, northward. And",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:37": "Yea, even to a considerable distance, insomuch that when they saw",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:38": "And now Antipus, beholding our danger, did speed the march of his",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:39": "And it came to pass that before the dawn of the morning, behold,",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:40": "Now they durst not turn to the right nor to the left lest they",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:41": "And it came to pass that again, when the light of the morning",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:42": "But it came to pass that they did not pursue us far before they",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:43": "And now, whether they were overtaken by Antipus we knew not, but",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:44": "Therefore what say ye, my sons, will ye go against them to",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:45": "And now I say unto you, my beloved brother Moroni, that never had",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:46": "For as I had ever called them my sons (for they were all of them",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:47": "Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:48": "And they rehearsed unto me the words of their mothers, saying: We",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:49": "And it came to pass that I did return with my two thousand",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:50": "The army of Antipus being weary, because of their long march in",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:51": "For Antipus had fallen by the sword, and many of his leaders,",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:52": "And it came to pass that the Lamanites took courage, and began to",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:53": "Now when the people of Antipus saw that the Lamanites had turned",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:54": "And now it came to pass that we, the people of Nephi, the people",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:55": "And now it came to pass that when they had surrendered themselves",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:56": "But behold, to my great joy, there had not one soul of them",
  "The Son Of Alma 56:57": "And as we had no place for our prisoners, that we could guard",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:1": "And now it came to pass that I received an epistle from Ammoron,",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:2": "But I sent an epistle unto the king, that we were sure our forces",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:3": "And Ammoron refused mine epistle, for he would not exchange",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:4": "But the people of Antiparah did leave the city, and fled to their",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:5": "And thus ended the twenty and eighth year of the reign of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:6": "And it came to pass that in the commencement of the twenty and",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:7": "And it came to pass that it was our desire to wage a battle with",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:8": "And now behold, I will show unto you that we soon accomplished our",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:9": "And it came to pass that we did camp round about the city for many",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:10": "At length their provisions did arrive, and they were about to",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:11": "And notwithstanding the Lamanites being cut off from their",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:12": "And it came to pass that not many days had passed away before the",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:13": "But it came to pass that our prisoners were so numerous that,",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:14": "For behold, they would break out in great numbers, and would",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:15": "Therefore it became expedient for us, that we should put an end",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:16": "And now, in those critical circumstances, it became a very",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:17": "But it came to pass that on the morrow they did return. And now",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:18": "And it came to pass that those men whom we sent with the",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:19": "But behold, my little band of two thousand and sixty fought most",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:20": "And as the remainder of our army were about to give way before",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:21": "Yea, and they did obey and observe to perform every word of",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:22": "And now behold, it was these my sons, and those men who had been",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:23": "And we retained our city Cumeni, and were not all destroyed by",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:24": "And it came to pass that after the Lamanites had fled, I",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:25": "And it came to pass that there were two hundred, out of my two",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:26": "And now, their preservation was astonishing to our whole army,",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:27": "Now this was the faith of these of whom I have spoken; they are",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:28": "And now it came to pass that after we had thus taken care of our",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:29": "Now Gid was the chief captain over the band who was appointed to",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:30": "And now, these are the words which Gid said unto me: Behold, we",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:31": "And they cried unto us, saying—Behold, the armies of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:32": "And it came to pass that our prisoners did hear their cries,",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:33": "And it came to pass because of their rebellion we did cause that",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:34": "And behold, when they had fled and we could not overtake them, we",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:35": "And behold, we are again delivered out of the hands of our",
  "The Son Of Alma 57:36": "Now it came to pass that when I, Helaman, had heard these words",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:1": "And behold, now it came to pass that our next object was to obtain",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:2": "And they were so much more numerous than was our army that we",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:3": "Yea, and it became expedient that we should employ our men to the",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:4": "And it came to pass that I thus did send an embassy to the",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:5": "But behold, this did profit us but little; for the Lamanites were",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:6": "And the Lamanites were sallying forth against us from time to",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:7": "And it came to pass that we did wait in these difficult",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:8": "But it came to pass that we did receive food, which was guarded to",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:9": "And now the cause of these our embarrassments, or the cause why",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:10": "Therefore we did pour out our souls in prayer to God, that he",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:11": "Yea, and it came to pass that the Lord our God did visit us with",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:12": "And we did take courage with our small force which we had",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:13": "And thus we did go forth with all our might against the",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:14": "And it came to pass that on the morrow, that when the Lamanites",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:15": "And it came to pass that when they saw that we were not strong,",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:16": "And when we saw that they were making preparations to come out",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:17": "Now Gid and his men were on the right and the others on the left;",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:18": "And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come out with their",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:19": "And it came to pass that the Lamanites did follow after us with",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:20": "And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had passed by, or",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:21": "And it came to pass that when they had cut them off, they ran to",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:23": "And it came to pass that Gid and Teomner by this means had",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:24": "And when the Lamanites saw that they were marching towards the",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:25": "And behold, it was night and they did pitch their tents, for the",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:26": "Now it came to pass that when it was night, I caused that my men",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:27": "And because of this our march in the night-time, behold, on the",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:28": "And thus it came to pass, that by this stratagem we did take",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:29": "And it came to pass that when the armies of the Lamanites did",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:30": "Yea, and it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites did",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:31": "And those cities which had been taken by the Lamanites, all of",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:32": "But behold, our armies are small to maintain so great a number of",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:33": "But behold, we trust in our God who has given us victory over",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:34": "Now we do not know the cause that the government does not grant",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:35": "Behold, we do not know but what ye are unsuccessful, and ye have",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:36": "And if it is not so, behold, we fear that there is some faction",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:37": "But, behold, it mattereth not—we trust God will deliver us,",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:38": "Behold, this is the twenty and ninth year, in the latter end, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:39": "And those sons of the people of Ammon, of whom I have so highly",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:40": "But behold, they have received many wounds; nevertheless they",
  "The Son Of Alma 58:41": "And now, my beloved brother, Moroni, may the Lord our God, who",
  "The Son Of Alma 59:1": "Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year of the reign of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 59:2": "Yea, and he did make it known unto all his people, in all the land",
  "The Son Of Alma 59:3": "And it came to pass that he immediately sent an epistle to",
  "The Son Of Alma 59:4": "And it came to pass when Moroni had sent this epistle to the land",
  "The Son Of Alma 59:5": "And it came to pass that while Moroni was thus making preparations",
  "The Son Of Alma 59:6": "Yea, even those who had been compelled to flee from the land of",
  "The Son Of Alma 59:7": "And thus being exceedingly numerous, yea, and receiving strength",
  "The Son Of Alma 59:8": "And their armies were so numerous that the remainder of the people",
  "The Son Of Alma 59:9": "And now as Moroni had supposed that there should be men sent to",
  "The Son Of Alma 59:10": "Therefore he retained all his force to maintain those places",
  "The Son Of Alma 59:11": "And now, when Moroni saw that the city of Nephihah was lost he",
  "The Son Of Alma 59:12": "Now this was the case with all his chief captains. They doubted",
  "The Son Of Alma 59:13": "And it came to pass that Moroni was angry with the government,",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:1": "And it came to pass that he wrote again to the governor of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:2": "For behold, I have somewhat to say unto them by the way of",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:3": "And now behold, I say unto you that myself, and also my men, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:4": "But behold, were this all we had suffered we would not murmur nor",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:5": "But behold, great has been the slaughter among our people; yea,",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:6": "And now behold, we desire to know the cause of this exceedingly",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:7": "Can you think to sit upon your thrones in a state of thoughtless",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:8": "Yea, even they who have looked up to you for protection, yea, have",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:9": "But behold, this is not all—ye have withheld your provisions from",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:10": "And now, my beloved brethren—for ye ought to be beloved; yea, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:11": "Behold, could ye suppose that ye could sit upon your thrones, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:12": "Do ye suppose that, because so many of your brethren have been",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:13": "For the Lord suffereth the righteous to be slain that his justice",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:14": "And now behold, I say unto you, I fear exceedingly that the",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:15": "For were it not for the wickedness which first commenced at our",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:16": "Yea, had it not been for the war which broke out among ourselves;",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:17": "But behold, now the Lamanites are coming upon us, taking",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:18": "But why should I say much concerning this matter? For we know not",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:19": "Or is it that ye have neglected us because ye are in the heart of",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:20": "Have ye forgotten the commandments of the Lord your God? Yea,",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:21": "Or do ye suppose that the Lord will still deliver us, while we",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:22": "Yea, will ye sit in idleness while ye are surrounded with",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:23": "Do ye suppose that God will look upon you as guiltless while ye",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:24": "And now, except ye do repent of that which ye have done, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:25": "And except ye grant mine epistle, and come out and show unto me a",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:26": "And this because of their exceeding faith, and their patience in",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:27": "And I will come unto you, and if there be any among you that has",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:28": "Yea, behold I do not fear your power nor your authority, but it",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:29": "Behold it is time, yea, the time is now at hand, that except ye",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:30": "Behold, I wait for assistance from you; and, except ye do",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:31": "For behold, the Lord will not suffer that ye shall live and wax",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:32": "Behold, can you suppose that the Lord will spare you and come out",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:33": "Ye know that ye do transgress the laws of God, and ye do know",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:34": "And now behold, I, Moroni, am constrained, according to the",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:35": "And behold, if ye will not do this I come unto you speedily; for",
  "The Son Of Alma 60:36": "Behold, I am Moroni, your chief captain. I seek not for power,",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:1": "Behold, now it came to pass that soon after Moroni had sent his",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:2": "I, Pahoran, who am the chief governor of this land, do send these",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:3": "But behold, there are those who do joy in your afflictions, yea,",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:4": "And it is those who have sought to take away the judgment-seat",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:5": "And behold, they have driven me out before them, and I have fled",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:6": "And behold, I have sent a proclamation throughout this part of the",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:7": "And they have come unto us, insomuch that those who have risen up",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:8": "They have got possession of the land, or the city, of Zarahemla;",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:9": "And now, in your epistle you have censured me, but it mattereth",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:10": "And now, behold, we will resist wickedness even unto bloodshed.",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:11": "We would not shed the blood of our brethren if they would not",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:12": "We would subject ourselves to the yoke of bondage if it were",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:13": "But behold he doth not command us that we shall subject ourselves",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:14": "Therefore, my beloved brother, Moroni, let us resist evil, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:15": "Therefore, come unto me speedily with a few of your men, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:16": "Behold I have sent a few provisions unto them, that they may not",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:17": "Gather together whatsoever force ye can upon your march hither,",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:18": "And we will take possession of the city of Zarahemla, that we may",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:19": "And now, Moroni, I do joy in receiving your epistle, for I was",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:20": "But ye have said, except they repent the Lord hath commanded you",
  "The Son Of Alma 61:21": "See that ye strengthen Lehi and Teancum in the Lord; tell them to",
  "The Son Of Alma 62:1": "And now it came to pass that when Moroni had received this epistle",
  "The Son Of Alma 62:2": "But he did also mourn exceedingly because of the iniquity of those",
  "The Son Of Alma 62:3": "And it came to pass that Moroni took a small number of men,",
  "The Son Of Alma 62:4": "And he did raise the standard of liberty in whatsoever place he",
  "The Son Of Alma 62:5": "And it came to pass that thousands did flock unto his standard,",
  "The Son Of Alma 62:6": "And thus, when Moroni had gathered together whatsoever men he",
  "The Son Of Alma 62:7": "And it came to pass that Moroni and Pahoran went down with their",
  "The Son Of Alma 62:8": "And behold, Pachus was slain and his men were taken prisoners, and",
  "The Son Of Alma 62:9": "And the men of Pachus received their trial, according to the law,",
  "The Son Of Alma 62:10": "And thus it became expedient that this law should be strictly",
  "The Son Of Alma 62:11": "And thus ended the thirtieth year of the reign of the judges over",
